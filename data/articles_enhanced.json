    "content": "<p>When you’re running a project in a tech company, understanding that your main job is to <strong>ship the project</strong> goes a surprisingly long way. So many engineers spend their time on peripheral questions (like the choice of technology X or Y) when core questions about shipping the product (for instance, how all the critical paths will actually work) are still unanswered<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>If you’re able to reliably ship projects, you can get away with being slightly abrasive, or not filling out your Jira tickets correctly, or any number of other small faults that would cause other engineers to be punished.</p>\n<p>You could see this as a special case of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">Pareto principle</a>: the idea that 80% of consequences often come from 20% of causes. But I think in many contexts it’s even more extreme, closer to 90/10 or even 99/1. <strong>If you get the “main thing” right, you can get away with a lot of mistakes.</strong></p>\n<p>This principle holds in many other areas. When saving money, it doesn’t matter if you save a few dollars by hunting for deals if you then buy a car or house that’s on the edge of your budget. If you’re writing, clearly expressing your point will make up for awkward grammar or other mistakes, but even beautiful prose is bad writing if it doesn’t say what you mean. If you’re trying to get fit, consistency and avoiding injury is far more important than finding the most efficient program or the best gear. And so on.</p>\n<h3>Identifying the “main thing”</h3>\n<p><strong>How do you identify the main thing?</strong> This is a pretty deep question. I have written <em>extensively</em> about this when it comes to working in large tech companies: you can read <a href=\"/where-the-money-comes-from\"><em>Knowing where your engineer salary comes from</em></a>, or browse my posts tagged <a href=\"/tags/tech%20companies\">“tech companies”</a>. In under twenty words, I think it’s “delivering projects in order to increase shareholder value and make the ~2 layers of management above you happy”.</p>\n<p>From the way I’ve phrased it, it should be clear that I think this is the “main thing” <em>for working in tech companies</em>. It’s not the main thing for life in general, or for being a fulfilled software craftsperson, and so on. Those two domains have completely different main things<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the main thing seems too simple to be important. Plenty of software engineers think something like “of course it’s important to ship the project, but that only happens as a result of writing all the code”, underrating the set of complex factors (both in code and elsewhere) that have to come together for a successful ship.</p>\n<p>The only general reliable method I know is to carefully look at cases of success and failure, and to identify what the successes had in common. <strong>Pay particular attention to successes or failures that surprise you.</strong> If you thought a project was going really well but the people who ran it weren’t rewarded, or you thought a project was a complete disaster but it ended up being celebrated, that probably indicates that you’re mistaken about what the “main thing” is. Did someone get a staff promotion but you think they’re terrible? Is someone beloved by senior leadership, but you can’t see them doing anything that useful? Those people are probably getting the main thing right<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<h3>It’s hard to even try</h3>\n<p>The first step in correctly identifying the main thing is to <em>try</em>. In my experience, <strong>it is surprisingly hard to motivate yourself to focus on the main thing</strong>. It’s much more natural to just jump into something that looks probably useful and start working immediately. Why is this?</p>\n<p>One obvious reason is that it just feels bad to sit around contemplating all the things you could focus on. It’s much easier to account for your time - both to others and to yourself - if you look busy. What if you can’t come up with anything, and you’ve just wasted all the time you spent reflecting?</p>\n<p>Another, less obvious reason is that <strong>many people are afraid that they might not like the main thing</strong>. Recall my description of the main thing at tech companies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“delivering projects in order to increase shareholder value and make the ~2 layers of management above you happy”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lots of software engineers really hate that this is the most important thing. I wrote about this at length in <a href=\"/a-little-bit-cynical\"><em>Software engineers should be a little bit cynical</em></a> and <a href=\"/knowing-how-to-drive-the-car\"><em>You have to know how to drive the car</em></a>. If you don’t like this goal at all, it’s going to be tough to spend time thinking about how you can achieve it.</p>\n<p>In fact, I think <strong>it’s actually more important to think about the “main thing” if you hate it</strong>. This is why I’m suspicious of “do what you love” advice. If you love performance engineering but your company doesn’t, I think you’re better off doing it in your spare time and creating shareholder value at work, instead of trying to do as much performance engineering at work as you can.</p>\n<p>Half-assing creating shareholder value a few hours a day (and doing performance engineering the rest of the time) is more valuable than locking in to the wrong “main thing” for ten hours a day. In my experience, it’s also likely more burnout-resistant, since there’s no faster path to burnout than working really hard on something that isn’t valued.</p>\n<h3>Caution: the “main thing” can rapidly change</h3>\n<p>In 2015, being easy to work with was the most important thing in many tech companies. If you were a pleasant colleague, you had to be <em>really</em> bad at other aspects of the job to face serious professional consequences. On the other hand, if you were abrasive and hard to work with, it didn’t really matter how technically competent you were. Many engineers made successful careers by maximizing pleasantness: attending and hosting work social events, making friendly connections in different teams, and in general becoming a known engineer in the company.</p>\n<p>In 2026, it’s still important to be pleasant. But now that tech companies are <a href=\"/good-times-are-over\">tightening their belts</a> and feeling more pressure to ship, the <em>most</em> important thing has shifted to being capable of <a href=\"/how-to-ship\">delivering projects</a>. If you’re able to do that, it can go a long way towards redeeming a difficult personality. Like love, shipping <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2010%3A11-13&#x26;version=NKJV\">covers all sins</a>. This transition has been a bumpy ride for many software engineers.</p>\n<p>A lot of very pleasant “known engineers” have been laid off in the last three years. I suppose the lesson here is something like this: <strong>even if you’re doing great and are well-adapted to your niche, the environment can change and screw you over anyway</strong>. What can you do about it? If you’ve spent a good chunk of your career developing one set of skills, you can’t instantly transfer all that experience to a different set of skills when the environment changes. Maybe the underlying lesson is more like this: <strong>instead of over-specializing to a single niche, hedge your bets by being pretty good at multiple things</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>The lesson here is that <strong>you should spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out what to focus on</strong>. In the extreme case, even spending half of your time doing this is worthwhile, if it puts you on the right track and you’d otherwise be neglecting the main thing.</p>\n<p>This can seem pretty unintuitive. It feels safer and more productive to be doing <em>something</em>. But if you can force yourself to focus on the meta-question of what you ought to be doing - even if you don’t like the answer - you’ll be in a better position to achieve your goals.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I write about this at length in <a href=\"/how-to-ship\"><em>How I ship projects at large tech companies</em></a>.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>I leave filling out what those are as an exercise to the reader.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>Or some people just get lucky! But that’s rarer than you might think. Getting the main thing right often looks like “constantly getting lucky” from the outside.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

    "content": "<p>A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself <strong>Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters</strong> (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying &#8212; perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a &#8220;We&#8217;re not paying&#8221; response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group&#8217;s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73160\" style=\"width: 758px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73160\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-73160\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dontfeed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"746\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dontfeed.png 915w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dontfeed-768x766.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dontfeed-782x780.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73160\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: Shutterstock.com, @Mungujakisa</p></div>\n<p>Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s according to <strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy <a href=\"https://unit221b.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unit 221B</a>. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they&#8217;ll do &#8212; such as destroying stolen data.</p>\n<p>Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that &#8212; to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim&#8217;s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.</p>\n<p>SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/expansion-shinyhunters-saas-data-theft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a January 30 blog post</a>, Google&#8217;s security forensics firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> said SLSH&#8217;s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,&#8221; the blog post explained.</p>\n<p>Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.</p>\n<p>Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to &#8220;swatting&#8221; attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target&#8217;s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A big part of what they&#8217;re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives&#8217; kids and threatening the board of the company,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they&#8217;re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, &#8216;Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we&#8217;re going to write about you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.unit221b.com/dont-read-this-blog/harassment-scare-tactics-why-victims-should-never-pay-shinyhunters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a blog post today</a>, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH&#8217;s known members hail from <strong>The Com</strong>, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration</a>.</p>\n<p>Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,&#8221; Nixon wrote. &#8220;They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms &#8211; unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and &#8220;promise&#8221; to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:</p>\n<p>A key component of SLSH&#8217;s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73163\" style=\"width: 758px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73163\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-73163\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"92\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png 935w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh-768x94.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh-782x96.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-73163\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An excerpt from a sextortion tutorial from a Com-based Telegram channel.

These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,&#8221; Unit 221B&#8217;s advisory reads. &#8220;Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or &#8220;A.N&#8221;), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.&#8221;</p>\n",

Vibe coding is the process of generating software using AI without being part of the process at all. You describe what you want in very general terms, and the LLM will produce whatever happens to be the first idea/design/code it would spontaneously, given the training, the specific sampling that happened to dominate in that run, and so forth. The vibe coder will, at most, report things not working or not in line with what they expected.\n<br>\n<br>When the process is actual software production where you know what is going on, remember: it is the software *you* are producing. Moreover remember that the pre-training data, while not the only part where the LLM learns (RL has its big weight) was produced by humans, so we are not appropriating something else. We can pretend AI generated code is \"ours\", we have the right to do so. Pre-training is, actually, our collective gift that allows many individuals to do things they could otherwise never do, like if we are now linked in a collective mind, in a certain way.\n<br>\n<br>That said, if vibe coding is the process of producing software without much understanding of what is going on (which has a place, and democratizes software production, so it is totally ok with me), automatic programming is the process of producing software that attempts to be high quality and strictly following the producer's vision of the software (this vision is multi-level: can go from how to do, exactly, certain things, at a higher level, to stepping in and tell the AI how to write a certain function), with the help of AI assistance. Also a fundamental part of the process is, of course, *what* to do.\n<br>\n<br>I'm a programmer, and I use automatic programming. The code I generate in this way is mine. My code, my output, my production. I, and you, can be proud.\n<br>\n<br>If you are not completely convinced, think to Redis. In Redis there is not much technical novelty, especially at its start it was just a sum of basic data structures and networking code that every competent system programmer could write.

    "link": "https://idiallo.com/blog/installed-single-turnstile-for-security-theater?src=feed",
    "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>After the acquisition by a much larger company, security became a top priority. Our company occupied three tall buildings, each at least 13 stories high. Key card readers were installed next to every entrance, every elevator car, and even at the parking lot entrance, which itself was eight stories tall.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>The parking lot system was activated first. If you wanted to park your car, you needed to scan your pass. It didn't take long for lines to start forming, but they were still manageable.</p>\n\n<p>Then the doors were activated. I would often forget my key card on my desk and get stuck in the stairwell. After lunch, I'd climb the stairs all the way to the 11th floor, only to find myself locked out at the door. Fortunately, the buildings were full of people, and there was always someone to open the door for me. I'd slip in suspiciously while they contemplated the email that clearly said not to let anyone in with your own card.</p>\n\n<p>While we were battling to get used to the key cards, the company was installing turnstiles on the ground floor of every building. They looked futuristic, but I was already anticipating a problem the designers hadn't considered. Each building had 13 floors. Each floor was full of employees. Hundreds of employees per building would each have to scan their card to get in.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a software engineer. I understand that security isn't an optional feature you build on top of your application. Instead, you need to implement safeguards at the foundation. In fact, one of the most important applications I was working on was a tool to manage how different teams retrieved their tasks from Jira. If you've read this blog before, you know I always complain about Jira.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the original designer of this application must have been pressed for time. Each action in the app required a call to the Jira endpoint, which needed authentication. He never saved the auth token returned by the API. Instead, each call had to re-authenticate and then perform its task.</p>\n\n<p>Did he ask the user to reenter the password every single time? No, he was smarter than that. Did he save the credentials in the database in plain text? He might have <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/hiring-angular-experts-not\">been an intern</a>, but he wasn't crazy. No! Instead, he saved the username and password in the cookies. But for good measures, it was base64 encoded.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, we received the email. All turnstiles were going to be activated. The following Monday, they would run in mock mode, where the turnstiles would remain open, but we'd have to scan and wait for the beep and green light before entering.</p>\n\n<p>I arrived at 8:30am. I met my colleagues and hundreds of other employees in the lobby. When the first person scanned their card, the machine beeped and turned green. We all clapped in celebration. We took turns making our way to the machine. Beep, turn green, next. But it grumbled for some employees and turned red. That was fine though, it was mock day. We all went about our day.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, when I came to work, I remained in my car, stuck in line for the parking lot for at least 10 minutes. Looking outside, I saw long lines of people circling each building.</p>\n\n<p>I managed to park my car and discovered that the line of people extended all the way down to the parking level. I waited in line for at least 30 minutes just to make it to the lobby. I texted my manager that I'd be late for the daily standup because I was stuck in line. She didn't text back. Instead, she waved at me from the front of the line. Scanning was already slow, you had to wait to be approved. But once you passed the turnstile, there was another line for the elevators. The elevator key card readers were also active.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a couple dozen people all trying to squeeze into crowded elevators, each going to a different floor, and each trying to scan their key card to access their floor because someone who wasn't authorized for that floor couldn't scan it for them. Some elevator doors opened with a few people already inside because they couldn't scan their cards in the crowd, so they'd gone back down for a second attempt. In other words, it was complete chaos.</p>\n\n<p>It took more than an hour to go from the parking lot to my desk on the 11th floor.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, I decided to save time and take an Uber to work. Those were the days when an <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/paying-for-my-8-years-old-ride\">Uber ride cost only $3</a>. I thought I was being smart, but another hundred people or so had the same idea. We had a pile of Uber rides lining up outside, each trying to drop off their riders and blocking the way to the parking lot, causing yet another traffic jam. Inside the building, it was still the same chaos. I only saved a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>On the third day, they shut down the turnstiles. They clearly weren't working. They also disabled the key card readers in the elevators. It was a relief.</p>\n\n<p>Security was supposedly a priority, yet nobody ever talked about the Jira credentials saved in cookies. I received significant pushback when I requested we install a Redis service to store the generated auth tokens. I had to write entire documents to justify using it and request enterprise support from a vendor. After a month, the security issue was fixed to no fanfare.</p>\n\n<p>We did, however, receive an email celebrating the installation of three new turnstiles in the lobby. They never turned the elevator key card readers back on. They remained dormant, a reminder of the mess we'd gone through.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The turnstiles were visible. They were expensive. They disrupted everyone's day and made headlines in company-wide emails. Management could point to them and say that we're taking security seriously. Meanwhile, thousands of employees had their Jira credentials stored in cookies. A vulnerability that could expose our entire project management system. But that fix required documentation, vendor approval, a month of convincing people it mattered. A whole lot of begging.</p>\n\n<p>Security theater checks a box. It makes people feel like something is being done. Real security is invisible. It's reviewing code, implementing proper authentication, storing tokens correctly. It doesn't come with a ribbon-cutting ceremony or a celebratory email. It's just good engineering that nobody notices when it's done right. But security theater is impossible to miss.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

Key is one of the most exciting new science fiction writers of this decade and today, Harpercollins publishes his debut novel, <em>The Hospital at the End of the World</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866\">https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-hospital-at-the-end-of-the-world-justin-c-key?variant=43822999928866</a></p>\n<p>I've followed Key's work for more than a decade, ever since I met him as a student while teaching at the Clarion West writers' workshop in Seattle. At the time, Key impressed me &#8211; a standout writer in a year full of standouts &#8211; and I wasn't surprised in the least when Harpercollins published a collection of his afrofuturist/Black horror stories, <em>The World Wasn't Ready For You</em>, in 2023:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015\">https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/19/justin-c-key/#clarion-west-2015</a></p>\n<p>This is virtually unheard of. Major genre publishers generally don't publish short story collections at all, let alone short story collections by writers who haven't already established themselves as novelists. The exceptions are rare as hell, and they're names to conjure with: Ted Chiang, say, or Kelly Link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/13/the-kissing-song/#wrack-and-roll</a></p>\n<p>But anyone who read <em>World Wasn't Ready</em> immediately understood why Key's work qualified him for an exception to this iron law of publishing. Key is an MD and a practicing psychiatrist, and he combines keen insights into personal relations and human frailty with a wild imagination, deep compassion, and enviable prose chops.</p>\n<p><em>Hospital at the End of the World</em> is Key's first novel, and it's terrific. Set in a not-so-distant future in which an AI-driven health monopolist called The Shepherd Organization controls much of the lives of everyday Americans, <em>Hospital</em> follows Pok, a young New Yorker who dreams of becoming an MD. Pok's father is also a doctor, famous for his empathic, human-centric methods and his scientific theories about the role that \"essence\" (a psychospiritual connection between doctors and patients) plays in clinical settings.</p>\n<p>The story opens with Pok hotly anticipating an acceptance letter from The Shepherd Organization, and the beginning of his new life as a medical student. But when word arrives, Pok learns that he has been rejected from <em>every</em> medical school in the TSO orbit. In desperate confusion, he works with shadowy hackers in a bid to learn why his impeccable application and his top grades resulted in this total rejection. That's when he learns that someone had sabotaged his application and falsified his grades, and, not long thereafter, he learns that the saboteur was his father.</p>\n<p>To make things worse, Pok's father has fallen grievously ill &#8211; so ill, in fact, that he ends up in a Shepherd Organization hospital, despite his deep enmity for TSO and its AI-driven practice of medicine. Pok doesn't accompany his father, though &#8211; he has secured a chance to sit a make-up exam in a desperate bid to get into med school. By the time he is finished with his exam, though, he learns that his father has died, and all that is left of him is an AI-powered chatbot that is delivered to Pok's apartment along with a warning to flee, because he is in terrible danger from the Shepherd Organization.</p>\n<p>Thus begins Pok's tale as he goes underground in a ubiquitous AI surveillance dystopia, seeking sanctuary in New Orleans, hoping to make it to the Hippocrates, the last holdout from America's AI-based medicine and surveillance dystopia. Pok's father learned to practice medicine at Hippocrates, and had urged Pok to study there, even securing a full-ride scholarship for him. But Pok had no interest in the mystical, squishy, sentimental ethos of the Hippocrates, and had been determined to practice the Shepherd Organization's rigorous, cold, data-driven form of medicine.</p>\n<p>Now, Pok has no choice. Hitchhiking, hopping freight cars, falling into company with other fugitives, Pok makes his way to New Orleans, a city guarded by tall towers that radiate energy that dampens both the punishing weather events that would otherwise drown the city and the data signals by which the Shepherd Organization tracks and controls the American people.</p>\n<p>This is the book's second act, a medical technothriller that sees Pok as an untrusted outsider in the freshman class at Hippocrates med school, amidst a strange and alarming plague that has sickened the other refugees from TSO America who have taken up residence in New Orleans. Pok has to navigate factions within the med school and in New Orleans society, even as he throws himself into the meat grinder of med school and unravels the secrets of his father and his own birth.</p>\n<p>What follows is a masterful and suspenseful work of science fiction informed by Key's own medical training and his keen sense of the human psyche. It's one part smart whodunnit, one part heist thriller, and one part revolutionary epic, and at its core is a profound series of provocations and thought experiments about the role that deep human connection and empathy play in medical care. It's a well-structured, well-paced sf novel that probes big, urgent contemporary themes while still engrossing the reader in the intimate human relations of its principals. A wonderful debut novel from a major new writer.`</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\n<h1 heds=\"0\">Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/04/slice-bees/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\"/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ken MacLeod: Imagined Futures <a href=\"https://plutopia.io/ken-macleod-imagined-futures/\">https://plutopia.io/ken-macleod-imagined-futures/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Elbows Up: How Canada Can Disenshittify Its Tech, Reclaim Its Sovereignty, and Launch a New Tech Sector Into a Stable Orbit <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation\">https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HOPE IS NOW A 501(C)(3) NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION <a href=\"https://2600.com/content/hope-now-501c3-non-profit-organization\">https://2600.com/content/hope-now-501c3-non-profit-organization</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Department of Justice appeals Google search monopoly ruling <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/873438/google-antitrust-case-doj-states-appeal\">https://www.theverge.com/tech/873438/google-antitrust-case-doj-states-appeal</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>List of Kennedy Center cancellations during the Trump administration <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kennedy_Center_cancellations_during_the_Trump_administration\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kennedy_Center_cancellations_during_the_Trump_administration</a> (h/t Amanda Marcotte)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<p><a name=\"retro\"></a><br />\n<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"A shelf of leatherbound history books with a gilt-stamped series title, 'The World's Famous Events.'\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/worlds-famous-events.png?w=840&#038;ssl=1\"/></p>\n<h1 heds=\"0\">Object permanence (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/04/slice-bees/#retro\">permalink</a>)</h1>\n<p>#20yrsago AOL/Yahoo: our email tax will make the net as good as the post office! <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/technology/postage-is-due-for-companies-sending-email.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/technology/postage-is-due-for-companies-sending-email.html</a></p>\n<p>#20yrsago Volunteers ferry 15k coconuts every day to Indian temple <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4677320.stm\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4677320.stm</a></p>\n<p>#15yrsago Wikileaks ACTA cables confirm it was a screwjob for the global poor <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/secret-us-cables-reveal-acta-was-far-too-secret/\">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/secret-us-cables-reveal-acta-was-far-too-secret/</a></p>\n<p>#10yrsago Laura Poitras’s Astro Noise: indispensable book and gallery show about mass surveillance <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/02/snowdens-chronicler-reveals-her-own-life-under-surveillance/\">https://www.wired.com/2016/02/snowdens-chronicler-reveals-her-own-life-under-surveillance/</a></p>\n<p>#10yrsago How to prepare to join the Internet of the dead <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Online_No_One_Knows_Youre_Dead\">https://archive.org/details/Online_No_One_Knows_Youre_Dead</a></p>\n<p>#10yrsago Who funds the “Millennials Rising” Super PAC?

The Examiner is, frankly, more of the same - and I'm happy with that!</p>\n\n<p>You, the reader, are given a series of transcripts and have to work out what crime (if any) has been committed. You don't find out who the victim(s) is/are until reasonably far through the story. The characters are well realised (although a little similar to some of her others). The twists are shockingly good and will make you flick back to see if you could have spotted them.</p>\n\n<p>Hallett is <em>exquisite</em> at building tension through the slow drip-drip-drip of reveals. OK, so the transcripts are a bit unrealistic but they make a good scaffold. While it might be nice to include user avatars on the WhatsApp messages, the characters' voices are unique enough to distinguish them easily.</p>\n\n<p>Much like <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/book-review-the-mysterious-case-of-the-alperton-angels-by-janice-hallett/\">The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels</a>, the book plays around with symbolism and the nature of faith. You may find yourself sympathising with the characters and then quickly recanting!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"technical-issues\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/book-review-the-examiner-janice-hallett/#technical-issues\">Technical Issues</a></h2>\n\n<p>Viper, the publisher, seem to have messed up the structure of this eBook. Despite being published in 2024, they're using an <em>ancient</em> and obsolete version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/FriendsOfEpub/Blitz/\">Blitz ePub CSS</a> which itself was archived back in 2020. As well as strange indents, there's a hard-coded 2em margin only on the right.</p>\n\n<p>Accessibility is poor. All the abbreviations use the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element. But some kind of automated find-and-replace has mangled most of them. For example, the \"Masters degree in Multimedia Art (Full-Time Programme)\" is shortened to \"MMAM(FTP)\" and then given the nonsensical abbreviation of \"Molecular Area Per Molecule (File Transfer Protocol)\"!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/08/how-long-does-it-take-to-upgrade-an-ebook/\">Much like before</a> I've written to them asking them to correct it.</p>\n",

    "title": "Why read novels?",
    "link": "https://dynomight.net/novels/",
    "content": "<p>Why should you read novels? We tell children they’re magic carpets for the mind / exercise for the soul instead of the body / lighthouses in the great sea of time. But aren’t they ultimately a form of entertainment?</p>\n\n<p>Many years ago, I read Crime and Punishment. Here, with no research and no notes, is what I can remember about that book:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>It was pretty good.</li>\n  <li>There was some guy, I think named Ras-something.</li>\n  <li>He was really angsty/edgy and lived in a small apartment or attic.</li>\n  <li>One day, for no particular reason, he killed an old woman.</li>\n  <li>Having done this random murder, he became even more angsty/edgy.</li>\n  <li>Then there was this police inspector guy.</li>\n  <li>The inspector kept coming after Ras-whoever and making extremely long philosophical rants.</li>\n  <li>Those rants may or may not have represented the personal views of Fyodor Dostoevsky.</li>\n  <li>I can’t remember how the book ended. Surely Ras-whoever didn’t live happily ever after? But was he caught or did he confess? No idea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is probably below average. I know people who seem to remember every detail of everything they read. But even if you’re one of them, so what? Is remembering those books better than remembering whatever else you would have done with your time if you hadn’t been reading?</p>\n\n<p>And yet: If I’m on vacation and I spend an afternoon reading a novel where in the mountains or on a beach, I feel like I’m living my best life. Whereas if I spent an afternoon staring at short videos on my phone, I’m sure I’d feel like a gigantic loser. So what’s going on here?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theory-1-ye-olde-status\">Theory 1: Ye olde status</h2>\n\n<p>The obvious explanation is that there’s nothing intrinsically great about reading novels. The reason we think it’s great is that reading novels—at least the right ones—is high status. It’s a way of playing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game\">Glass Bead Game</a>, a way of collecting <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/bourdieu/\">cultural capital</a> for you to lord over other people who don’t have as much time or education as you do. It may <em>feel</em> like you “actually enjoy reading”, but that’s because you’re a desperate striver that subconsciously shape-shifts into whatever you think will make you look fancy. Apologize for reading. Apologize!</p>\n\n<p>I think there is something in this. However, I’m also pretty sure it’s not the full explanation, and I’m bored to death with everyone trying to explain everything this way. So let’s move on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theory-2-diminishing-returns\">Theory 2: Diminishing returns</h2>\n\n<p>Say you can’t read novels. Maybe because you’re illiterate, maybe because you have no attention span, maybe because you can’t tear yourself away from Candy Clicker. Now, say you cultivate the ability to read novels. Whatever issues you address in that process, it seems like it will clearly be good for you, right?</p>\n\n<p>Under this theory, what’s important is having the <em>ability</em> to read novels. But said ability is acquired by reading novels, so read some novels.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, say you <em>could</em> read novels, but you simply never have. It’s plausible that the first time you have the “novel” experience of taking photons into your eyes and mentally converting them into a story, this truly does feed your mind.</p>\n\n<p>Both versions of this theory suggest that reading novels has diminishing returns. That fits nicely with the fact that many people push their children to read novels while not reading any themselves. But do we really believe that after you’ve read some number of novels, it’s pointless to read more?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theory-3-common-language\">Theory 3: Common language</h2>\n\n<p>I think Catcher in the Rye is a good but not great book. But I love talking about Catcher in the Rye because (1) all North Americans seem to have read it, and (2) whenever I ask someone to tell me how they feel about Holden Caulfield, I always seem to learn something about them.</p>\n\n<p>(I find him sympathetic.)</p>\n\n<p>If there’s a group of people talking about Catcher in the Rye—or The Three-Body Problem, or Infinite Jest, or Don Quixote—then you benefit from being able to participate. The cynic might argue that this is zero-sum status competition. But I don’t think that’s most of it. Because, at least in my social circles, people feel boorish talking about books if not everyone has read them. So these conversations only happen if everyone has read the book in question.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, we’re all alone in the world, and trying to connect with each other by pushing air through our throat meat. With more shared cultural context, those meat sounds are more meaningful, so we can all feel less alone.</p>\n\n<p>True. But shared context can come from other things, too, like traveling to the same places, or watching the same sports, or practicing the same skills or hobbies. So what makes books special? The two answers I see are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Nothing. If you think they’re better than other types of cultural context, that’s because you’re a book person.</li>\n  <li>Books leave more room for interpretation. Maybe Don Quixote is a fanatic, maybe he’s an idealist, maybe he’s a “wise fool”. It’s debatable. But there’s no doubt who won the last World Cup.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I lean weakly towards the first answer. Novels are a useful form of social context. But that’s a side benefit. It’s not why we read most books.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theory-4-legible-mind-space\">Theory 4: Legible mind-space</h2>\n\n<p>Maybe novels are just another form of entertainment. OK. But say you tried to tell the same story as a novel or as movie / podcast / opera / interpretive dance performance. Different formats will be better in different ways. One advantage I see for novels is that they make it natural to explore the interior worlds of the characters.</p>\n\n<p>Some movies have voice-overs where characters explain what they’re thinking. But this is generally considered cringe and a poor use of the medium. Meanwhile, many books are <em>mostly</em> about exploring what the characters are thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts are worth exploring. If you want to explore thoughts, maybe novels are the best way to do that.</p>\n\n<p><em>Aside</em>: I’ve mentioned before that I think My Brilliant Friend is the best TV show ever made. Can I confess that I like it much more than the books it is based on? Because, like the books, the TV show involves a <em>lot</em> of what the main character is thinking, and even makes heavy use of voice-overs. So maybe other mediums have unrealized potential?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theory-5-purity-of-vision\">Theory 5: Purity of vision</h2>\n\n<p>Movies are expensive to make. To be financially viable, they need to target a large slice of the population. Movies also reflect the combined efforts of many people. Both of these mean that movies are a compromise between different visions.</p>\n\n<p>Novels are usually written by one person. And they’re often written more for personal expression than to make money. After all, writing is fun. I mean—writing is hard, but would you rather spend an afternoon holding up a shotgun microphone, cleaning a movie star’s trailer, or writing a novel?</p>\n\n<p>To quantify this, some searching suggests that around 10,000 feature films are released each year, as compared to around 1,000,000 novels. (Does one in 7,000 people really write a novel each year?) That’s two orders of magnitude. So if you want to hear a truly unique story, a pure vision of one person, maybe novels are where you’ll find it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theory-6-all-these-theories-are-stupid\">Theory 6: All these theories are stupid</h2>\n\n<p>Or: Maybe the point of reading War and Peace is that War and Peace is incredible and obviously one of the greatest pieces of art ever made in any medium. No one who reads War and Peace can question the value of what they’ve done. What are we talking about?</p>\n\n<p>Fair. I definitely feel like I’m living my best life when I read War and Peace. But I also feel like I’m living an OK-ish life when I read a novel about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spenser_(character)\">Spenser, private investigator</a>. And most novels most people read are closer to the Spenser than to War and Peace. And I still feel better spending an afternoon reading about Spenser than I would watching 99% of TV shows.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theory-7-dopamine\">Theory 7: Dopamine</h2>\n\n<p>Or perhaps the difference is that reading is a thing you <em>do</em> rather than something you <em>consume</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This theory holds than when spend an hour slurping up short-form video, you’re training yourself to sort of pull a lever in the hope that some reward is delivered to you. But if you read (or do watercolors, or meditate) you’re training yourself to calmly pursue long-term goals and to sustain attention in the face of complexity.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I wonder if phones/apps are the most addictive thing ever created. I suspect that more people today are addicted to their phones today than were ever addicted to any drug other than caffeine or perhaps nicotine. And while a phone addiction is less physically harmful than tobacco, that phone addiction will eat a larger part of your soul.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is a big part of the explanation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theory-8-non-fungible-time\">Theory 8: Non-fungible time</h2>\n\n<p>In the end, I don’t think novels are the best way to spend your time. In my view no novel—not even War and Peace—is as good as a truly great conversation.</p>\n\n<p>But great conversations are hard to create. Sometimes you’re sitting on a train, or laying in bed, or it’s just been a long day and you don’t have the energy to find a giant block of marble and pursue your dream of experimental sculpture. In these situations, maybe reading a novel is the best thing you could do in the category of things you could realistically do.</p>\n\n<p>Exercise for the reader: Apply these theories to blog posts.</p>",

    "link": "http://www.righto.com/feeds/7538688365288775324/comments/default",
    "content": "<p>In 1978, Intel introduced the 8086 processor, a revolutionary chip that led to the modern x86 architecture.\nUnlike modern 64-bit processors, however, the 8086 is a 16-bit chip.\nIts arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) operates on 16-bit values, performing arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction,\nas well as logic operations including bitwise AND, OR, and XOR.\nThe 8086's ALU is a complicated part of the chip, performing 28 operations in total.<span id=\"fnref:operations\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:operations\">1</a></span></p>\n<p>In this post, I discuss the circuitry that controls the ALU, generating the appropriate control signals for a\nparticular operation.\nThe process is more complicated than you might expect. First, a machine code instruction results in the execution of multiple\nmicrocode instructions.\nUsing the ALU is a two-step process: one microcode instruction (micro-instruction) configures the ALU for the desired operation,\nwhile a second\nmicro-instruction gets the results from the ALU.\nMoreover, based on both the microcode micro-instruction and the machine code instruction, the control circuitry sends control signals to the ALU,\nreconfiguring it for the desired operation.\nThus, this circuitry provides the \"glue\" between the micro-instructions and the ALU.</p>\n<p>The die photo below shows the 8086 processor under a microscope.\nI've labeled the key functional blocks.\nArchitecturally, the chip is partitioned into a Bus Interface Unit (BIU) at the top and an Execution Unit (EU) below.\nThe BIU handles bus and memory activity as well as instruction prefetching, while the Execution Unit (EU) executes the instructions.\nIn the lower right corner, the microcode ROM holds the micro-instructions.\nThe ALU is in the lower left corner, with bits 7-0 above and bits 15-8 below, sandwiching the status flag circuitry.\nThe ALU control circuitry, highlighted in red at the bottom of the chip, is the focus of this article.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8086-alu-notes/die-labeled2.jpg\"><img alt=\"The die of the 8086 with the metal layer removed to show the silicon and polysilicon underneath.

Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.</div></p>\n<h2>Microcode</h2>\n<p>The 8086 processor implements most machine instructions in microcode, with a micro-instruction for each step of the machine instruction.\n(I discuss the 8086's microcode in detail <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2022/11/how-8086-processors-microcode-engine.html\">here</a>.)\nThe 8086 uses an interesting architecture for microcode:\neach micro-instruction performs two unrelated operations. The first operation moves data between a source and a destination.\nThe second operation can range from a jump or subroutine call to a memory read/write or an ALU operation.\nAn ALU operation has a five-bit field to specify a particular operation and a two-bit field to specify\nwhich temporary register provides the input. As you'll see below, these two fields play an important role in the ALU circuitry.</p>\n<p>In many cases, the 8086's micro-instruction doesn't specify the ALU operation, leaving the details to be substituted from the machine instruction opcode.\nFor instance, the ADD, SUB, ADC, SBB, AND, OR, XOR, and CMP\nmachine instructions share the same microcode, while the hardware selects the ALU operation from the instruction opcode.\nLikewise, the increment and decrement instructions use the same microcode, as do the decimal adjust instructions DAA and DAS, and the\nASCII adjust instructions AAA and AAS.\nInside the micro-instruction, all these operations are performed with a \"pseudo\" ALU operation called XI (for some reason).\nIf the microcode specifies an XI ALU operation, the hardware replaces it with the ALU operation specified in the instruction.\nAnother important feature of the microcode is \nthat you need to perform one ALU micro-instruction to configure the ALU's operation, but the result isn't\navailable until a later micro-instruction, which moves the result to a destination.\nThis has the consequence that the hardware must remember the ALU operation.</p>\n<p>To make this concrete, here is the microcode that implements a typical arithmetic instruction such as <code>ADD AL, BL</code> or <code>XOR [BX+DI], CX</code>.\nThis microcode consists of three micro-instructions. \nThe left half of each micro-instruction specifies a data movement, first moving the two arguments to ALU temporary registers\nand then storing the ALU result (called Σ).\nThe right half of each micro-instruction performs the second task.\nFirst, the ALU is configured to perform an <code>XI</code> operation using temporary register A. Recall that <code>XI</code> indicates the ALU operation\nis filled in from the machine instruction; this is how the same microcode handles eight different types of machine instructions.\nIn the second micro-instruction, the next machine instruction is started unless a memory writeback is required (<code>WB</code>).\nThe last micro-instruction is <code>RNI</code> (Run Next Instruction) to start a new machine instruction. It also indicates that the\nprocessor status flags (<code>F</code>) should be updated to indicate if the ALU result is zero, positive, overflow, and so forth.<span id=\"fnref:addressing\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:addressing\">2</a></span></p>\n<style>\n  pre.microcode {font-family: courier, fixed; padding: 10px; background-color: #f5f5f5; display:inline-block;border:none;}\n  pre.microcode span {color: green; font-style:italic; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 90%;}\n</style>\n<pre class=\"microcode\">\nM → tmpa   XI   tmpa  <span>Load first argument, configure ALU.</span>\nR → tmpb   WB,NXT     <span>Load second argument, start Next instruction if no memory writeback</span>\nΣ → M      RNI  F     <span>Store ALU result, Run Next Instruction, update status Flags</span>\n</pre>\n\n<h2>The ALU circuit</h2>\n<p>The ALU is the heart of a processor, performing arithmetic and logic operations.\nMicroprocessors of the 1970s typically supported addition and subtraction; logical AND, OR, and XOR; and various bit shift operations.\n(Although the 8086 had multiply and divide instructions, these were implemented in microcode, not in the ALU.)\nSince an ALU is both large and critical to performance, chip architects try to optimize its design.\nAs a result, different microprocessors have widely different ALU designs.\nFor instance, the 6502 microprocessor has separate circuits for addition and each logic operation; a multiplexer selects the appropriate\noutput.\nThe Intel 8085, on the other hand, uses an optimized clump of gates that performs the desired operation based on control signals (<a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2013/01/inside-alu-of-8085-microprocessor.html\">details</a>), while the Z80's 4-bit ALU uses a different clump of gates (<a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2013/09/the-z-80-has-4-bit-alu-heres-how-it.html\">details</a>).</p>\n<p>The 8086 takes a different approach, using two lookup tables (along with other gates) to generate the carry and output signals for each bit in the ALU.\nBy setting the lookup tables appropriately, the ALU can be configured to perform the desired operation.\n(This is similar to how an FPGA implements arbitrary functions through lookup tables.)\nThe schematic below shows the circuit for one bit of the ALU.\nI won't explain this circuit in detail since I explained it in <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2020/08/reverse-engineering-8086s.html\">an earlier article</a>.<span id=\"fnref:shift-right\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:shift-right\">3</a></span>\nThe relevant part of this circuit is the six control signals at the left.\nThe two multiplexers (trapezoidal symbols) implement the lookup tables by using the two input argument bits to select outputs from\nthe control signals to control carry generation and carry propagation.\nThus, by feeding appropriate control signals into the ALU, the 8086 can reconfigure the ALU to perform the desired operation.\nFor instance, with one set of control signals, this circuit will add. Other sets of control signals will cause the circuit to subtract\nor compute a logical operation, such as AND or XOR.\nThe 8086 has 16 copies of this circuit, so it operates on 16-bit values.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8086-alu-notes/alu-schematic.png\"><img alt=\"The circuit that implements one bit in the 8086's ALU.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8086-alu-notes/alu-schematic-w600.png\" title=\"The circuit that implements one bit in the 8086's ALU.\" width=\"600\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">The circuit that implements one bit in the 8086's ALU.</div></p>\n<p>The 8086 is a complicated processor, and its instructions have many special cases, so controlling the ALU is\nmore complex than described above.\nFor instance, the compare operation is the same as a subtraction, except the numerical result of a compare is discarded; just the\nstatus flags are updated.\nThe add versus add-with-carry instructions require different values for the carry into bit 0, while subtraction requires the\ncarry flag to be inverted since it is treated as a borrow.\nThe 8086's ALU supports increment and decrement operations, but also increment and decrement by 2, which requires an increment signal into bit\n1 instead of bit 0.\nThe bit-shift operations all require special treatment. For instance, a rotate can use the carry bit or exclude the carry bit, while\nand arithmetic shift right requires the top bit to be duplicated.\nAs a result, along with the six lookup table (LUT) control signals, the ALU also requires numerous control signals to adjust its\nbehavior for specific instructions.\nIn the next section, I'll explain how these control signals are generated.</p>\n<h2>ALU control circuitry on the die</h2>\n<p>The diagram below shows the components of the ALU control logic as they appear on the die.\nThe information from the micro-instruction enters at the right and is stored in the latches.\nThe PLAs (Programmable Logic Arrays) decode the instruction and generate the control signals.\nThese signals flow to the left, where they control the ALU.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8086-alu-notes/logic-labeled.jpg\"><img alt=\"The ALU control logic as it appears on the die.

I removed the metal layer to show the underlying polysilicon and silicon. The reddish lines are remnants of the metal.</div></p>\n<p>As explained earlier, if the microcode specifies the <code>XI</code> operation, the operation field is replaced with a value based on the machine instruction opcode.\nThis substitution is performed by the <code>XI</code> multiplexer before the value is stored in the operation latch.\nBecause of the complexity of the 8086 instruction set, the <code>XI</code> operation is not as straightforward as you might expect.\nThis multiplexer gets three instruction bits from a special register called the \"X\" register, another instruction bit from the instruction\nregister, and the final bit from a decoding circuit called the Group Decode ROM.<span id=\"fnref:xi\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:xi\">4</a></span></p>\n<p>Recall that one micro-instruction specifies the ALU operation, and a later micro-instruction accesses the result. Thus, the\nALU control circuitry must remember the specified operation so it can be used later. \nIn particular, the control circuitry must keep track of the ALU operation to perform and the temporary register specified.\nThe control circuitry uses three flip-flops to keep track of the specified temporary register, one flip-flop for each register.\nThe micro-instruction contains a two-bit field that specifies the temporary register. The control circuitry decodes this field and\nactivates the associated flip-flop.\nThe outputs from these flip-flops go to the ALU and enable the associated temporary register.\nAt the start of each machine instruction,<span id=\"fnref:sc\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:sc\">5</a></span> the flip-flops are reset, so temporary register A is selected by default.</p>\n<p>The control circuitry uses five flip-flops to store the five-bit operation field from the micro-instruction.\nAt the start of each machine instruction, the flip-flops are reset so operation 0 (ADD) is specified by default.\nOne important consequence is that an add operation can potentially be performed without a micro-instruction to configure the ALU,\nshortening the microcode by one micro-instruction and thus shortening the instruction time by one cycle.</p>\n<p>The five-bit output from the operation flip-flops goes to the operation PLA (Programmable Logic Array)<span id=\"fnref:pla\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:pla\">7</a></span>, which decodes the operation\ninto 27 control signals.<span id=\"fnref:control\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:control\">6</a></span>\nMany of these signals go to the ALU, where they control the behavior of the ALU for special cases.\nAbout 15 of these signals go to the Lookup Table (LUT) PLA, which generates the six lookup table signals for the ALU.\nAt the left side of the LUT PLA, special high-current driver circuits amplify the control signals before they are sent to the ALU.\nDetails on these drivers are in the footnotes.<span id=\"fnref:driver\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:driver\">8</a></span></p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Whenever I look at the circuitry of the 8086 processor, I see the differences between a RISC chip and a CISC chip.\nIn a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor such as ARM, instruction decoding is straightforward, as is the processor circuitry.\nBut in the 8086, a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) processor, there are corner cases and complications everywhere.\nFor instance, an 8086 machine instruction sometimes specifies the ALU operation in the first byte and sometimes in the second byte,\nand sometimes elsewhere, so the X register latch, the XI multiplexer, and the Group Decode ROM are needed.\nThe 8086's ALU includes obscure operations including four types of BCD adjustments and seven types of shifts, making the ALU more\ncomplicated.\nOf course, the continuing success of x86 shows that this complexity also has benefits.</p>\n<p>This article has been a deep dive into the details of the 8086's ALU, but I hope you have found it interesting.\nIf it's too much detail for you, you might prefer my overview of the <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2020/08/reverse-engineering-8086s.html\">8086 ALU</a>.</p>\n<p>For updates, follow me on\n Bluesky (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/righto.com\">@righto.com</a>),\nMastodon (<a href=\"https://oldbytes.space/@kenshirriff\">@kenshirriff@oldbytes.space</a>),\nor <a href=\"http://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p>Credits:\nThanks to Marcin Peczarski for discussion.\nMy microcode analysis is based on Andrew Jenner's <a href=\"https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/\">8086 microcode disassembly</a>.</p>\n<h2>Notes and references</h2>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:operations\">\n<p><style type=\"text/css\">\n  table#aluops {border-collapse: collapse;}\n  table#aluops td {border: 1px solid #ccc;

you can add a number to itself.)</p>\n<p>The adjust operations (DAA, DAS, AAA, AAS) also use completely separate circuitry.\nThese operations generate correction factors for BCD (binary-coded decimal) arithmetic based on the value and flags.\nThe circuitry for these operations is located with the flags circuitry, separate from the rest of the ALU circuitry.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:shift-right\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:xi\">\n<p>In more detail, the 8086 stores bits 5-3 of the machine instruction in the \"X\" register.\nFor an XI operation, the X register bits become bits 2-0 of the ALU operation specification, while bit 3 comes from bit 6 of the\ninstruction, and bit 4 comes from the <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2023/05/8086-processor-group-decode-rom.html\">Group Decode ROM</a> for\ncertain instructions.\nThe point of this is that the instruction set is designed so bits of the instruction correspond to bits of the ALU operation\nspecifier, but the mapping is more complicated than you might expect.\nThe eight basic arithmetic/logic operations (ADD, SUB, OR, etc) have a straightforward mapping that is visible from\nthe <a href=\"http://www.mlsite.net/8086/\">8086 opcode table</a>, but the mapping for other instructions isn't as obvious.\nMoreover, sometimes the operation is specified in the first byte of the machine instruction, but sometimes it is specified\nin the second byte, which is why the X register needs to store the relevant bits.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:xi\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 4 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:sc\">\n<p>The flip-flops are reset by a signal in the 8086, called \"Second Clock\". When a new machine instruction is started, the \"First Clock\" signal\nis generated on the instruction's first byte and the \"Second Clock\" signal is generated on the instruction's second byte.\n(Note that these signals are not necessarily on consecutive clock cycles, because a memory fetch may be required if the\ninstruction queue is empty.)\nWhy are the flip-flops reset on Second Clock and not First Clock? The 8086 has a small degree of pipelining, so the previous\nmicro-instruction may still be finishing up during First Clock of the next instruction. By Second Clock, it is safe to reset\nthe ALU state.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:sc\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 5 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:control\">\n<p>For reference, the 27 outputs from the PLA are triggered by the following ALU micro-operations:</p>\n<p>Output 0: RRCY (right rotate through carry) \n<br>Output 1: ROR (Rotate Right) \n<br>Output 2: BCD Adjustments: DAA (Decimal Adjust after Addition), DAS (Decimal Adjust after Subtraction), AAA (ASCII Adjust after Subtraction), or AAS (ASCII Adjust after Subtraction) \n<br>Output 3: SAR (Shift Arithmetic Right)\n<br>Output 4: Left shift: ROL (Rotate Left), RCL (Rotate through Carry Left), SHL (Shift Left), or SETMO (Set Minus One)\n<br>Output 5: Right shift: ROR (Rotate Right), RCR (Rotate through Carry Right), SHR (Shift Right), or SAR (Shift Arithmetic Right)\n<br>Output 6: INC2 (increment by 2) \n<br>Output 7: ROL (Rotate Left) \n<br>Output 8: RCL (Rotate through Carry Left)\n<br>Output 9: ADC (add with carry) \n<br>Output 10: DEC2 (decrement by 2) \n<br>Output 11: INC (increment) \n<br>Output 12: NEG (negate) \n<br>Output 13: ALU operation 12 (unused?)\n<br>Output 14: SUB (Subtract), CMP (Compare), DAS (Decimal Adjust after Subtraction), AAS (ASCII Adjust after Subtraction)\n<br>Output 15: SBB (Subtract with Borrow) \n<br>Output 16: ROL (Rotate Left) or RCL (Rotate through Carry Left)\n<br>Output 17: ADD or ADC (Add with Carry)\n<br>Output 18: DEC or DEC2 (Decrement by 1 or 2)\n<br>Output 19: PASS (pass-through) or INC (Increment)\n<br>Output 20: COM1 (1's Complement) or NEG (Negate) \n<br>Output 21: XOR \n<br>Output 22: OR \n<br>Output 23: AND \n<br>Output 24: SHL (Shift Left)\n<br>Output 25: DAA or AAA (Decimal/ASCII Adjust after Addition)\n<br>Output 26: CMP (Compare)&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:control\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 6 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:pla\">\n<p>A Programmable Logic Array is a way of implementing logic gates in a structured grid.

Together, the layers produce \"sum-of-products\" outputs,\nconsisting of multiple terms OR'd together.\nThe ALU's PLA is a bit unusual because many outputs are taken directly from the OR layer, while only about 15 outputs from the\nfirst layer are fed into the second layer.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:pla\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 7 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:driver\">\n<p>The control signals pass through the driver circuit below.\nThe operation of this circuit puzzled me for years, since the transistor with its gate at +5V seems to be stuck on.\nBut I was looking at the book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/49JlB8M\">DRAM Circuit Design</a> and spotted the same circuit, called \nthe \"Bootstrap Wordline Driver\".\nThe purpose of this circuit is to boost the output to a higher voltage than a regular NMOS circuit, providing better performance.\nThe problem with NMOS circuitry is that NMOS transistors aren't very good at pulling a signal high: due to the properties of the\ntransistor, the output voltage is less than the gate voltage, lower by the threshold voltage V<sub>TH</sub>, half a volt or more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8086-alu-notes/signal-drive.png\"><img alt=\"The drive signals to the ALU gates are generated with this dynamic circuit.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"149\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8086-alu-notes/signal-drive-w250.png\" title=\"The drive signals to the ALU gates are generated with this dynamic circuit.\" width=\"250\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">The drive signals to the ALU gates are generated with this dynamic circuit.</div></p>\n<p>The bootstrap circuit takes advantage of capacitance to get more voltage out of the circuit.\nSpecifically, suppose the input is +5V, while the clock is high. Point A will be about 4.5V, losing half a volt due to the threshold.\nNow, suppose the clock goes low, so the inverted clock driving the upper transistor goes high.\nDue to capacitance in the second transistor, as the source and drain go high, the gate will\nbe pulled above its previous voltage, maybe gaining a couple of volts.\nThe high voltage on the gate produces a full-voltage output, avoiding\nthe drop due to V<sub>TH</sub>.\nBut why the transistor with its gate at +5V? This transistor acts somewhat like a diode, preventing the boosted voltage from flowing\nbackward through the input and dissipating.</p>\n<p>The bootstrap circuit is used on the ALU's lookup table control signals for two reasons.\nFirst, these control signals drive pass transistors. A pass transistor suffers from a voltage drop due to the threshold voltage,\nso you want to start with a control signal with as high a voltage as possible.\nSecond, each control signal is connected to 16 transistors (one for each bit).\nThis is a large number of transistors to drive from one signal, since each transistor has gate capacitance.\nIncreasing the voltage helps overcome the R-C (resistor-capacitor) delay, improving performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8086-alu-notes/bootstrap-diagram.jpg\"><img alt=\"A close-up of the bootstrap drive circuits, in the left half of the LUT PLA.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8086-alu-notes/bootstrap-diagram-w400.jpg\" title=\"A close-up of the bootstrap drive circuits, in the left half of the LUT PLA.\" width=\"400\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">A close-up of the bootstrap drive circuits, in the left half of the LUT PLA.</div></p>\n<p>The diagram above shows six bootstrap drivers on the die.

It went by many names. The\nmost recent one is <a href=\"https://openclaw.ai/\">OpenClaw</a> but in the news you might\nhave encountered it as ClawdBot or MoltBot depending on when you read about it.\nIt is an agent connected to a communication channel of your choice that <a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/3/tools/\">just\nruns code</a>.</p>\n<p>What you might be less familiar with is that what&#8217;s under the hood of OpenClaw\nis a little coding agent called <a href=\"https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/\">Pi</a>. And\nPi happens to be, at this point, the coding agent that I use almost exclusively.\nOver the last few weeks I became more and more of a shill for the little agent.\nAfter I gave a talk on this recently, I realized that I did not actually write\nabout Pi on this blog yet, so I feel like I might want to give some context on\nwhy I&#8217;m obsessed with it, and how it relates to OpenClaw.</p>\n<p>Pi is written by <a href=\"https://mariozechner.at/\">Mario Zechner</a> and unlike Peter, who\naims for &#8220;sci-fi with a touch of madness,&#8221; <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> Mario is very grounded.  Despite\nthe differences in approach, both OpenClaw and Pi follow the same idea: LLMs are\nreally good at writing and running code, so embrace this.  In some ways I think\nthat&#8217;s not an accident because Peter got me and Mario hooked on this idea, and\nagents last year.</p>\n<h2>What is Pi?</h2>\n<p>So Pi is a coding agent.  And there are many coding agents.  Really, I think you\ncan pick effectively anyone off the shelf at this point and you will be able to\nexperience what it&#8217;s like to do agentic programming.  In reviews on this blog\nI&#8217;ve positively talked about AMP and one of the reasons I resonated so much with\nAMP is that it really felt like it was a product built by people who got both\naddicted to agentic programming but also had tried a few different things to see\nwhich ones work and not just to build a fancy UI around it.</p>\n<p>Pi is interesting to me because of two main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First of all, it has a tiny core. It has the shortest system prompt of any\nagent that I&#8217;m aware of and it only has four tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash. </li>\n<li>The second thing is that it makes up for its tiny core by providing an\nextension system that also allows extensions to persist state into sessions,\nwhich is incredibly powerful. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>And a little bonus: Pi itself is written like excellent software. It doesn&#8217;t\nflicker, it doesn&#8217;t consume a lot of memory, it doesn&#8217;t randomly break, it is\nvery reliable and it is written by someone who takes great care of what goes\ninto the software.</p>\n<p>Pi also is a collection of little components that you can build your own agent\non top.  That&#8217;s how OpenClaw is built, and that&#8217;s also how I built my own little\nTelegram bot and how Mario built his\n<a href=\"https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/mom\">mom</a>.  If you want\nto build your own agent, connected to something, Pi when pointed to itself and\nmom, will conjure one up for you.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s Not In Pi</h2>\n<p>And in order to understand what&#8217;s in Pi, it&#8217;s even more important to understand\nwhat&#8217;s not in Pi, why it&#8217;s not in Pi and more importantly: why it won&#8217;t be in\nPi.  The most obvious omission is support for MCP.  There is no MCP support in\nit. While you could build an extension for it, you can also do what OpenClaw\ndoes to support MCP which is to use\n<a href=\"https://github.com/steipete/mcporter\">mcporter</a>. mcporter exposes MCP calls via\na CLI interface or TypeScript bindings and maybe your agent can do something\nwith it.  Or not, I don&#8217;t know :)</p>\n<p>And this is not a lazy omission.  This is from the philosophy of how Pi works.\nPi&#8217;s entire idea is that if you want the agent to do something that it doesn&#8217;t\ndo yet, you don&#8217;t go and download an extension or a skill or something like\nthis. You ask the agent to extend itself.  It celebrates the idea of code\nwriting and running code.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that you cannot download extensions.  It is very much\nsupported. But instead of necessarily encouraging you to download someone else&#8217;s\nextension, you can also point your agent to an already existing extension, say\nlike, build it like the thing you see over there, but make these changes to it\nthat you like.</p>\n<h2>Agents Built for Agents Building Agents</h2>\n<p>When you look at what Pi and by extension OpenClaw are doing, there is an\nexample of software that is malleable like clay.  And this sets certain\nrequirements for the underlying architecture of it that are actually in many\nways setting certain constraints on the system that really need to go into the\ncore design.</p>\n<p>So for instance, Pi&#8217;s underlying AI SDK is written so that a session can really\ncontain many different messages from many different model providers. It\nrecognizes that the portability of sessions is somewhat limited between model\nproviders and so it doesn&#8217;t lean in too much into any model-provider-specific\nfeature set that cannot be transferred to another.</p>\n<p>The second is that in addition to the model messages it maintains custom\nmessages in the session files which can be used by extensions to store state or\nby the system itself to maintain information that either not at all is sent to\nthe AI or only parts of it.</p>\n<p>Because this system exists and extension state can also be persisted to disk, it\nhas built-in hot reloading so that the agent can write code, reload, test it and\ngo in a loop until your extension actually is functional.  It also ships with\ndocumentation and examples that the agent itself can use to extend itself.  Even\nbetter: sessions in Pi are trees.  You can branch and navigate within a session\nwhich opens up all kinds of interesting opportunities such as enabling workflows\nfor making a side-quest to fix a broken agent tool without wasting context in\nthe main session.  After the tool is fixed, I can rewind the session back to\nearlier and Pi summarizes what has happened on the other branch.</p>\n<p>This all matters because for instance if you consider how MCP works, on most\nmodel providers, tools for MCP, like any tool for the LLM, need to be loaded\ninto the system context or the tool section thereof on session start.  That\nmakes it very hard to impossible to fully reload what tools can do without\ntrashing the complete cache or confusing the AI about how prior invocations work\ndifferently.</p>\n<h2>Tools Outside The Context</h2>\n<p>An extension in Pi can register a tool to be available to the LLM to call and\nevery once in a while I find this useful. For instance, despite my criticism of\nhow Beads is implemented, I do think that giving an agent access to a to-do list\nis a very useful thing. And I do use an agent-specific issue tracker that works\nlocally that I had my agent build itself. And because I wanted the agent to also\nmanage to-dos, in this particular case I decided to give it a tool rather than a\nCLI.  It felt appropriate for the scope of the problem and it is currently the\nonly additional tool that I&#8217;m loading into my context.</p>\n<p>But for the most part all of what I&#8217;m adding to my agent are either skills or\nTUI extensions to make working with the agent more enjoyable for me.  Beyond\nslash commands, Pi extensions can render custom TUI components directly in the\nterminal: spinners, progress bars, interactive file pickers, data tables,\npreview panes.  The TUI is flexible enough that Mario proved you can <a href=\"https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2008702661093454039\">run Doom\nin it</a>.  Not practical,\nbut if you can run Doom, you can certainly build a useful dashboard or debugging\ninterface.</p>\n<p>I want to highlight some of my extensions to give you an idea of what&#8217;s\npossible.  While you can use them unmodified, the whole idea really is that you\npoint your agent to one and remix it to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/answer.ts\"><code>/answer</code></a></h3>\n<p>I <a href=\"/2025/12/17/what-is-plan-mode/\">don&#8217;t use plan mode</a>.  I encourage the agent\nto ask questions and there&#8217;s a productive back and forth.  But I don&#8217;t like\nstructured question dialogs that happen if you give the agent a question tool.\nI prefer the agent&#8217;s natural prose with explanations and diagrams interspersed.</p>\n<p>The problem: answering questions inline gets messy.  So <code>/answer</code> reads the\nagent&#8217;s last response, extracts all the questions, and reformats them into a\nnice input box.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/pi-answer.png\" alt=\"The /answer extension showing a question dialog\" style=\"width: 100%\">\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/todos.ts\"><code>/todos</code></a></h3>\n<p>Even though I criticize <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\">Beads</a> for its\nimplementation, giving an agent a to-do list is genuinely useful.  The <code>/todos</code>\ncommand brings up all items stored in <code>.pi/todos</code> as markdown files.  Both the\nagent and I can manipulate them, and sessions can claim tasks to mark them as in\nprogress.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 16/9\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcKbzxziA5k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/review.ts\"><code>/review</code></a></h3>\n<p>As more code is written by agents, it makes little sense to throw unfinished\nwork at humans before an agent has reviewed it first.  Because Pi sessions are\ntrees, I can branch into a fresh review context, get findings, then bring fixes\nback to the main session.</p>\n<img src=\"/static/pi-review.png\" alt=\"The /review extension showing review preset options\" style=\"width: 100%\">\n<p>The UI is modeled after Codex which provides easy to review commits, diffs,\nuncommitted changes, or remote PRs.  The prompt pays attention to things I care\nabout so I get the call-outs I want (eg: I ask it to call out newly added\ndependencies.)</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/control.ts\"><code>/control</code></a></h3>\n<p>An extension I experiment with but don&#8217;t actively use.  It lets one Pi agent send\nprompts to another.  It is a simple multi-agent system without complex\norchestration which is useful for experimentation.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/pi-extensions/files.ts\"><code>/files</code></a></h3>\n<p>Lists all files changed or referenced in the session.  You can reveal them in\nFinder, diff in VS Code, quick-look them, or reference them in your prompt.\n<code>shift+ctrl+r</code> quick-looks the most recently mentioned file which is handy when\nthe agent produces a PDF.</p>\n<p>Others have built extensions too: <a href=\"https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents\">Nico&#8217;s subagent\nextension</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-interactive-shell\">interactive-shell</a> which\nlets Pi autonomously run interactive CLIs in an observable TUI overlay.</p>\n<h2>Software Building Software</h2>\n<p>These are all just ideas of what you can do with your agent.  The point of it\nmostly is that none of this was written by me, it was created by the agent to my\nspecifications.  I told Pi to make an extension and it did.  There is no MCP, there are\nno community skills, nothing.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I use tons of skills.  But\nthey are hand-crafted by my clanker and not downloaded from anywhere.  For\ninstance I fully replaced all my CLIs or MCPs for browser automation with a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/blob/main/skills/web-browser/SKILL.md\">skill that just uses\nCDP</a>.\nNot because the alternatives don&#8217;t work, or are bad, but because this is just\neasy and natural.  The agent maintains its own functionality.</p>\n<p>My agent has <a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff/tree/main/skills\">quite a few\nskills</a> and crucially\nI throw skills away if I don&#8217;t need them.  I for instance gave it a skill to\nread Pi sessions that other engineers shared, which helps with code review.  Or\nI have a skill to help the agent craft the commit messages and commit behavior I\nwant, and how to update changelogs.  These were originally slash commands, but\nI&#8217;m currently migrating them to skills to see if this works equally well.  I\nalso have a skill that hopefully helps Pi use <code>uv</code> rather than <code>pip</code>, but I also\nadded a custom extension to intercept calls to <code>pip</code> and <code>python</code> to redirect\nthem to <code>uv</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Part of the fascination that working with a minimal agent like Pi gave me is\nthat it makes you live that idea of using software that builds more software.\nThat taken to the extreme is when you remove the UI and output and connect it\nto your chat.  That&#8217;s what OpenClaw does and given its tremendous growth,\nI really feel more and more that this is going to become our future in one\nway or another.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2017313990548865292\">https://x.com/steipete/status/2017313990548865292</a><a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Although I didn&apos;t expect much from vibe-code, I figured this service would be helpful for my future Telegram-based OSINT activities that I might (will) conduct.</p><p>And voila! <br>The <code>tg-crawler</code> is running on my Coolify (same as every other service I run lol), writing all of the data to a Postgres DB, from where I can boot up jupyter notebook and dig into the data. </p><p>Currently, my small instance of the crawler (more on the <strong>big</strong> one later) crawls through 81 chat and has already collected 222k messages from 6k users - just enough for some analysis as you&apos;ll see soon. </p><h3 id=\"going-with-gephi\">Going with Gephi</h3><p>As I loaded all tables into pandas and studied the data for a little bit, I began to understand that my &quot;standard&quot; pandas / mathplotlib flow wouldn&apos;t work out as it had done in some of my previous attempts in data visualisation. </p><p>My goal was to find (and show) all sorts of connections that exist between the chats, their admins, users and so on - at that point I was not aware if they had all been created by a single team or individual scammers. </p><p>Naturally, I decided to try plotting it all as a big graph and then just looking at various parts and layers of it, trying to figure out the patterns and connections. <br>Those who know me are aware that I&apos;m quite obsessed with graphs and network visualisations, though until now I rarely had such a good fit dataset to go all in on graphvis (one of my latest ones may be found <a href=\"https://timsh.org/everyone-knows-your-location-part-2-try-it-yourself/#visualising-domain-power\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>). </p><p>After some attempts to plot the data using PyVis (which I used previously) I quickly realised that, due to the graph size and complexity, I would need some help to work it out. I decided to settle on Gephi for the graph visualisation, but immediately got stuck in the complex and 2006ish interface of it. </p><p>So I reached out to <a href=\"https://iggisv9t.xyz/?ref=timsh.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">iggisv9t</a> - a very experienced network visualisation professional, whose Telegram channel I&apos;d been subscribed to for quite some time, - and asked him for help with handling Gephi in the right way. <br>And so he did! Huge shoutout and thanks to him. </p><p>I think it&apos;s time we look into the graphs!</p><h2 id=\"scam-network-visualisation\">Scam network visualisation </h2><p>Let&apos;s start with the overview graph. </p><h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/11/image-23.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Scam Telegram: Uncovering a network of groups spreading crypto drainers\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1969\" srcset=\"https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/image-23.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/image-23.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-23.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w2400/2025/11/image-23.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This is a complete representation of all (important) connections between the chats, their admins and users:</p><ul><li>admins are represented as small red nodes</li><li>users are small grey nodes</li><li>chats are the &quot;empty&quot; nodes of different size - depending on the amount of edges (connections) they have</li><li>you won&apos;t be able to see them clearly from this graph, but phishing urls are small white nodes. </li></ul><p>The edges (connections) in this graph are messages sent by a user or admin to a chat, coloured by their age: the oldest ones are red, the medium-age ones are closer to yellow, and the most recent ones are blue. </p><p>While it looks absolutely crazy already, there is not much we can tell from it right now - it looks a bit chaotic.

switching from one fake protocol support group to another. </p><p>While most of the chat admins are smart enough to clear out the chat history before the current protocol had been chosen, I was lucky to find a couple where they didn&apos;t bother to do so: </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/11/image-45.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Scam Telegram: Uncovering a network of groups spreading crypto drainers\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"953\" srcset=\"https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/image-45.png 600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/image-45.png 1000w, https://timsh.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-45.png 1600w, https://timsh.org/content/images/2025/11/image-45.png 2334w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">it&apos;s probably older than 24.10.24 and was cleared out before transforming into Layer3 group</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next, it&apos;s getting re-filled with bots -

Claude didn&apos;t even begin to move in the right direction, apart from producing dozens of .md report saying things like &quot;CRITICAL FINDING: THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING&quot;. <br>Also, due to the file size (~6 mb of obfuscated js ~ 30k rows), Claude was unable to parse the whole file and tried to make these brilliant guesses from the little parts of it. </p><p>After wasting a couple of hours with this genius md-shitting investigator, I decided to give up on the idea that I would be able to deobfuscate it by myself relying only on llms and my basic js knowledge, none of which relevant to obfuscation techniques. </p><p>At that point, I reached out in the <a href=\"https://timsh.org/why-you-should-self-host/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ETHSecurity</a> community on Telegram, seeking advice on deobfuscating &quot;some js&quot;. A few hours later, <a href=\"https://x.com/__noided?ref=timsh.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">noid</a> reached out to me and offered help. </p><p>Soon enough, he was able to extract some data from it, but still there were 80%+ of obfuscated js remaining.

</div></div><h2 id=\"my-thoughts-on-how-to-protect-your-community\">My thoughts on how to protect your community</h2><p>As I&apos;d shown above, this scam scheme affects almost every DeFi protocol out there. <br>It puts lots of web3 users to risk and damages protocol&apos;s and the entire space reputation, especially along the newbies who just started journey in web3 and got scammed in brutal fashion.  </p><p>I assume you&apos;re someone who could push for the changes in the DeFi world, so I&apos;ll get straight into my opinionated suggestions: </p><ol><li><strong>Always list the links to ALL of your official channels</strong> / chats / profiles on all of your resources. <br><strong>If you don&apos;t have an official Telegram community</strong>, for example, - <strong>MENTION it</strong> right next to the icons / links leading to your official resources.<br>I understand that it should be obvious to people that anything not present on your website is a scam, but it&apos;s not. </li><li>When you&apos;re getting started with your protocol (or even when you&apos;re already big &amp; cool), try to <strong>take out (reserve) every username that could potentially be used by scammers.</strong> <br>I understand that it might be impossible to even find all of the possible usernames that could impersonate your official accounts, but come on - usernames like <code>&lt;protocol_name&gt; + Official or Support</code> should not be available to scammers! <br>If you don&apos;t want to manage the community on Telegram or somewhere else - just turn it into a channel and put a single placeholder message there, leading users to other platforms where you do offer support. </li><li>Finally, since we&apos;re already here - <strong>anticipate</strong> the various ways scammers could impersonate as your members / resources and react. <br>You&apos;re definitely capable of looking up your own protocol name + official in the Telegram search. <br>If you do find something that&apos;s clearly a scam - report it to SEAL via <a href=\"https://t.me/seal_911_bot?ref=timsh.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">911 bot</a>, report it to Telegram and ask your real community to report it as well - I am not very optimistic when it comes to chat takedown by Telegram mods, but I believe that hundreds or thousands of reports from the legitimate users will lead to some action by Telegram. <br>It&apos;s definitely better than doing nothing and letting these chats live on for years. </li></ol><p>Imo it&apos;s also important to remember that while you might consider people falling for this &quot;idiots&quot; who don&apos;t belong to your sophisticated trustless decentralised protocol community, as the space grows and attracts newbies, there will always be victims of such scams. </p><p>They will later go to X / Reddit to tell their story and be shamed for their insufficient discretion, leaving them alone with funds lost. <br>If you don&apos;t believe these people exist - go to reddit and search for <code>&lt;protocol name&gt; + scam</code> - trust me, you&apos;ll probably find some poor guy&apos;s message from the last couple of days. </p><p>This can&apos;t have any positive effect on the reputation of both your protocol and the web3 space in general. It&apos;s already one of the main reasons why general public considers all crypto to be nothing more than a scam. </p><p>In case you want any help or suggestions on fighting the existing chats or other forms of scam made in the name of your protocol - reach out and I&apos;ll try to help or bring in others who will. </p><p>Stay safe! </p>",

    "content": "<p>This post is on the second half of chapter 7 of\n<a href=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/\">Sebastian Raschka</a>'s book\n\"<a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch\">Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)</a>\".\nIn the <a href=\"/2025/10/llm-from-scratch-25-instruction-fine-tuning\">last post</a> I covered\nthe part of the chapter that covers instruction fine-tuning; this time round,\nwe evaluate our model -- particularly interestingly, we try using another, smarter,\nmodel to judge how good its responses are.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, Raschka's explanation in this section is very clear, and there's not\nthat much that was conceptually new to me, so I don't have that many\nnotes -- in fact, this post is probably the shortest one in my series so far!</p>\n<h3 id=\"generating-the-test-set-responses\">Generating the test set responses</h3>\n\n<p>Unusually, when at the start of section 7.7 we generate\nsome sample responses for the instructions in our test set, I got exactly the same\nresults as in the book.  For once, I guess, everything that uses randomness was\nhappening in the same order as it did when Raschka ran it on his machine.</p>\n\n<p>The next step was to generate a file with all of the responses to all of the\ntest instructions, which took 18.9 seconds on my RTX 3090 (compared to\na minute on an A100, per the book -- that's quite surprising!)</p>\n\n<p>Once that was done, it was time to install Ollama so that I could use the Llama 3\nmodel to evaluate my own.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ollama\">Ollama</h3>\n\n<p>I've never used Ollama before -- when playing with other people's models, I've always\nused <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index\">Hugging Face's Transformers</a>\nlibrary.</p>\n\n<p>It's a neat package, though.  It wraps <code>llama.cpp</code>, which is a pure C/C++ inference\nframework (with CUDA support), and makes it easy to download and run models that\nhave been packaged for it.  Being written in C, I would imagine that it's faster than\nPyTorch/Transformers -- though, being inference-only, it's less useful if you're planning to do things\nlike training or fine-tuning the models.</p>\n\n<p>My desktop is running a fairly customised install of Arch Linux, and I didn't want to\nuse the default install procedure (which puts it into your system-wide <code>/bin</code> and <code>/lib</code>\ndirectories).  But it turns out that it's a very well-packaged app,\nand you don't need to do that.</p>\n\n<p>Using the manual <a href=\"https://docs.ollama.com/linux\">install instructions for Linux</a>,\nI just created a new directory <code>~/Dev/ollama</code>, and then <code>cd</code>ed there and downloaded it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code>wget<span class=\"w\"> </span>https://ollama.com/download/ollama-linux-amd64.tgz\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>It was about 1.75 GiB.  I then untarred it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code>tar<span class=\"w\"> </span>xf<span class=\"w\"> </span>ollama-linux-amd64.tgz\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>...and then I could run commands with full paths, for example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code>~/Dev/ollama/bin/ollama<span class=\"w\"> </span>serve\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>...to start up the server, or</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code>~/Dev/ollama/bin/ollama<span class=\"w\"> </span>run<span class=\"w\"> </span>llama3\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>...to start a session.</p>\n\n<p>Neat!  It's always good to see pre-built binary packages that have no issues with their install location.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"actually-running-the-evaluation\">Actually running the evaluation</h3>\n\n<p>The next step was to throw all of the generated test responses (and their associated\ntargets) at Llama 3 and see what it thought about how close they were.</p>\n\n<p>Again, this all worked without trouble.  I noted that the responses I was getting from Llama 3\nwere not the same as the ones in the book -- Raschka notes that\nOllama is non-deterministic, so there's no surprise there (though it does make me\nwonder why it accepts a <code>seed</code> parameter in the API call).</p>\n\n<p>When I got on to the final eval, where you run the test results through Llama 3\nand ask it to rate them compared to the target outputs, it took 11 seconds to run,\nand I got an average score of 48.95 / 100, which is close enough to the 50.32 that\nappears in the book. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> I'd run an eval on my model, using a smarter model to judge\nits responses!</p>\n\n<p>Somewhat surprisingly, that number was stable over multiple runs.  So perhaps there\nis some level of determinism in Ollama now that wasn't present when the book was written,\nand the seed (eg. <code>123</code>) is of value.  Or perhaps Raschka's comment about it being non-deterministic\nwas more of a \"between machines\" thing rather than for multiple runs on the same machine\n-- though then I'm not sure why he suggests re-running it for multiple results.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway -- that was it!  Eval done.  And, to my amazement, that was the end of\nthe chapter -- and almost the end of the  book.  We've built an LLM from scratch,\nfine-tuned it, and evaluated it by using a smarter model to judge how well it was\nfollowing instructions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"this-is-the-end\">This is the end...</h3>\n\n<p>...or at least the end of the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Having run the evaluation, I've reached the end of the main part of\n\"<a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch\">Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)</a>\".\nBut I don't think I've reached the end of this project, there's still more to do\n(not least working through the appendices).</p>\n\n<p>So, coming up next: a post summarising what I've got through so far in this series,\nand what the next steps are to wrap it up.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/2025/11/llm-from-scratch-27-whats-left-and-whats-next\">Here's a link to the next post in this series</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I also got 110 out of 110 scores -- that is, every response from Llama 3\nwas parseable as an integer.  That actually kind of surprised me!  Models like\nto be chatty and helpful.  But looking into it,\n<a href=\"https://x.com/goodside/status/1657396491676164096\">the famous X post by Riley Goodside</a>\nwhere he had to \"threaten\" Bard to stop it from saying \"Sure, no problem!  Here's your\nJSON\" was almost two years ago.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

This is how I historically have been running benchmarks and other experiments\nrequiring a repeated sequence of commands — type them manually once, then rely on shell history\n(and maybe some terminal splits) for reproduction. These past few years I’ve arrived at a much better\nworkflow pattern — <code>make.ts</code>. I was forced to adapt it once I started working with multiprocess\napplications, where manually entering commands is borderline infeasible. In retrospect, I should\nhave adapted the workflow years earlier.</p>\n<section id=\"The-Pattern\">\n\n<h2><a href=\"#The-Pattern\">The Pattern</a></h2>\n<p>Use a (gitignored) file for interactive scripting. Instead of entering a command directly into the\nterminal, write it to a file first, and then run the file. For me, I type stuff into <code>make.ts</code> and\nthen run <code>./make.ts</code> in my terminal (Ok, I need <em>one</em> <kbd><kbd>Up Enter</kbd></kbd> for that).</p>\n<p>I want to be clear here, I am not advocating writing “proper” scripts, just capturing your\ninteractive, ad-hoc command to a persistent file. Of course any command that you want to execute\n<em>repeatedly</em> belongs to the build system. The surprising thing is that even more complex one-off\ncommands benefit from running through file, because it will take you several tries to get them\nright!</p>\n<p>There are many benefits relative to <kbd><kbd>Up Up Up</kbd></kbd> workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nReal commands tend to get large, and it is so much nicer to use a real 2D text editor rather than\nshell’s line editor.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf you need more than one command, you can write several commands, and still run them all with a\nsingle key (before <code>make.ts</code>, I was prone to constructing rather horrific &amp;&amp; conjuncts for this\nreason).\n</li>\n<li>\nWith a sequence of command outlined, you nudge yourself towards incrementally improving them,\nmaking them idempotent, and otherwise investing into your own workflow for the next few minutes,\nwithout falling into the YAGNI pit from the outset.\n</li>\n<li>\nAt some point you might realize after, say, running a series of ad-hoc benchmarks interactively,\nthat you’d rather write a proper script which executes a collection of benchmarks with varying\nparameters. With the file approach, you already have the meat of the script implemented, and you\nonly need to wrap in a couple of fors and ifs.\n</li>\n<li>\nFinally, if you happen to work with multi-process projects, you’ll find it easier to manage\nconcurrency declaratively, spawning a tree of processes from a single script, rather than\nswitching between terminal splits.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section id=\"Details\">\n\n<h2><a href=\"#Details\">Details</a></h2>\n<p>Use a consistent filename for the script. I use <code>make.ts</code>, and so there’s a <code>make.ts</code> in the root\nof most projects I work on. Correspondingly, I have <code>make.ts</code> line in project’s <code>.git/info/exclude</code>\n— the <code>.gitignore</code> file which is not shared. The fixed name reduces fixed costs — whenever I\nneed complex interactivity I don’t need to come up with a name for a new file, I open my\npre-existing <code>make.ts</code>, wipe whatever was there and start hacking. Similarly, I have <code>./make.ts</code> in\nmy shell history, so\n<a href=\"https://fishshell.com/docs/current/interactive.html#autosuggestions\">fish autosuggestions</a>\nwork for me. At one point, I had a VS Code task to run <code>make.ts</code>, though I now use\n<a href=\"https://matklad.github.io/2025/08/31/vibe-coding-terminal-editor.html\">terminal editor</a>.</p>\n<p>Start the script with hash bang,\n<span class=\"display\"><code>#!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-all</code></span>\nin my case, and\n<span class=\"display\"><code>chmod a+x make.ts</code></span>\nthe file, to make it easy to run.</p>\n<p>Write the script in a language that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nyou are comfortable with,\n</li>\n<li>\ndoesn’t require huge setup,\n</li>\n<li>\nmakes it easy to spawn subprocesses,\n</li>\n<li>\nhas good support for concurrency.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For me, that is TypeScript. Modern JavaScript is sufficiently ergonomic, and structural, gradual\ntyping is a sweet spot that gives you reasonable code completion, but still allows brute-forcing any\nproblem by throwing enough stringly dicts at it.</p>\n<p>JavaScript’s tagged template syntax is brilliant for scripting use-cases:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">$</span>(<span class=\"hl-params\">literal, ...interpolated</span>) {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-variable language_\">console</span>.<span class=\"hl-title function_\">log</span>({ literal, interpolated });</span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> dir = <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;hello, world&quot;</span>;</span>\n<span class=\"line\">$<span class=\"hl-string\">`ls <span class=\"hl-subst\">${dir}</span>`</span>;</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>prints</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-punctuation\">{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\">    literal<span class=\"hl-punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"hl-punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;ls &quot;</span><span class=\"hl-punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class=\"hl-punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"hl-punctuation\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\">    interpolated<span class=\"hl-punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"hl-punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;hello, world&quot;</span> <span class=\"hl-punctuation\">]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-punctuation\">}</span></span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>What happens here is that <code>$</code> gets a list of literal string fragments inside the backticks, and\nthen, separately, a list of values to be interpolated in-between. It <em>could</em> concatenate everything\nto just a single string, but it doesn’t have to.

    "content": "<p>To understand what just happened in this week’s elections—notably Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York City, Mikie Sherrill’s win in New Jersey, and Abigail Spanberger’s win in Virginia—wind back the clock five years.</p><p>In 2020, Joe Biden won by promising that he could restore normalcy to American life. That did not happen. As the biological emergency of the coronavirus pandemic wound down, the economic emergency (inflation) took off. An <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/great-affordability-crisis-breaking-america/606046/?utm_source=feed\">affordability crisis</a> broke out around the world. The public revolted. Last year, practically every incumbent party in every developed country lost ground at the ballot box.</p><p>So it went in the United States. In 2024, Donald Trump won an “affordability election.” I’m calling it that because affordability is what Trump’s voters said they wanted more of. Gallup <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx\">found</a> that the economy was the only issue that a majority of voters considered “extremely important.” A CBS analysis of exit-poll data <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/exit-polls-2024-presidential-election/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">found</a> that eight in 10 of those who said they were worse off financially compared with four years ago backed Trump. The AP’s 120,000-respondent VoteCast survey <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/ap-votecast-voters-who-focused-on-the-economy-broke-hard-for-trump/\">found</a> that voters who cited inflation as their most important factor were almost twice as likely to back Trump.</p><p>So Trump won. And for the second straight election, the president has violated his mandate to restore normalcy. Elected to be an affordability president, Trump has governed as an authoritarian dilettante. He has raised tariffs without the consultation of Congress, openly threatened comedians who made jokes about him, pardoned billionaires who gave him and his family money, arrested people without due process, overseen the unconstitutional obliteration of the federal-government workforce, and, with the bulldozing of the White House East Wing, provided an admirably vivid metaphor for his general approach to governance, norms, and decorum.</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/trumps-gerrymandering-war-stalled/684833/?utm_source=feed\">Read: ‘None of this is good for Republicans’</a>]</i></p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/02/trump-economy-nbc-news-poll.html\">recent NBC poll</a> asked voters whether they thought Trump had lived up to their expectations for getting inflation under control and improving the cost of living. Only 30 percent said yes. It was his lowest number for any issue polled. The affordability issue, which seemed to be a rocket exploding upwards 12 months ago, now looks more like a bomb to which the Republican Party finds itself tightly strapped.</p><p>So again, we have an affordability election on our hands.</p><p>On the surface, Mamdani, Spanberger, and Sherrill emerged victorious in three very different campaigns. Mamdani defeated an older Democrat in an ocean-blue metropolis. In Virginia, Spanberger crushed a bizarre Republican candidate in a state that was ground zero for DOGE cuts. In New Jersey, Sherrill—whose victory margin was the surprise of the evening—romped in a state that had been sliding toward the Republican column.</p><p>Despite these cosmetic differences, what unified the three victories was the Democratic candidates’ ability to turn the affordability curse against the sitting president, transforming Republicans’ 2024 advantage into a 2025 albatross. Here’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/trump-elections-economy-inflation.html\">Shane Goldmacher</a> at <i>The New York Times</i>:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Democratic victories in New Jersey and Virginia were built on promises to address the sky-high cost of living in those states while blaming Mr. Trump and his allies for all that ails those places. In New York City, the sudden rise of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist with an ambitious agenda to lower the cost of living, put a punctuation mark on affordability as a political force in 2025.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Each candidate arguably got more out of affordability than any other approach. Mamdani’s focus on the cost of living in New York—which included some genuinely brilliant ads on, for example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyL4PsmA3u8\">“Halalflation”</a> and street-vendor permits—has been widely covered. Less ballyhooed, but just as important, is that Spanberger and Sherrill also found that the affordability message had the biggest bang for the buck in their own advertisements. An analysis shared with me by the polling and data firm Blue Rose Research found that “the best-testing ads in both Virginia and New Jersey focused on affordability, tying rising costs to Trump and Congressional Republicans.”</p><p>Tuesday night showed what affordability can be for the Democratic Party—not a policy, but a prompt, an opportunity for Democrats to fit different messages under the same tentpole while contributing to a shared national party identity: <i>The president’s a crook, and we care about the cost of living</i>. In New York City, Mamdani won renters by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/the-voters-who-propelled-mamdani-to-victory-e6a258b3?mod=hp_lead_pos7\">24 percentage points</a> with a specific promise: freeze the rent. In New Jersey, Sherrill won with a <a href=\"https://www.mikiesherrill.com/utilities.pdf\">day-one pledge</a> to declare a state of emergency on utility costs, which would allow her to halt rates and delete red tape that holds back energy generation. (The opening line of her mission statement: “Life in New Jersey is too expensive and every single New Jerseyan who pays the bills knows it.”) In Virginia, Spanberger went another way, relentlessly blaming rising costs on Trump.</p><p>What’s notable is not just what the above messages have in common but what they don’t. Sherrill focused on utility costs, whereas Mamdani focused on rent. Mamdani ran a socialist campaign to energize a young left-wing electorate, whereas Spanberger’s task was to win a purple state with an outgoing Republican governor. Each candidate answered the affordability prompt with a message tailored to the electorate: <i>Affordability is a big tent</i>.</p><p>The affordability message was especially successful at bringing young voters back to the Democratic fold. After the 2024 election, it looked like young people were <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/covid-youth-conservative-shift/681705/?utm_source=feed\">listing to the right</a>. Tuesday night was not the ideal test of that theory, because off-year elections tend to have a smaller and more educated (and therefore more naturally anti-Trump) electorate. But the pollster John Della Volpe reported that young voters <a href=\"https://x.com/dellavolpe/status/1985882537567375507?s=46\">“anchored the Democratic turnaround”</a> in Virginia, where 18-to-29-year-olds delivered a 35-point margin for Spanberger, the largest for Democrats since 2017.</p><p>It’s easy to understand why young voters would appreciate an emphasis on the cost of living. Just this week, the National Association of Realtors announced that the median age of first-time U.S. homebuyers has jumped to a new record of <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/first-time-home-buyer-share-falls-to-historic-low-of-21-median-age-rises-to-40\">40</a>. “Zohran’s campaign centered cost-of-living issues, and he at least appeared consistently willing to look for answers wherever they may present themselves,” Daniel Racz, a 23-year-old sport-data analyst who lives in New York, told me. “I think of his mentions of the history of sewer socialism, proposed trial runs of public grocery stores on an experimental basis, and his past free-bus pilot program, which showcased a political curiosity grounded in gathering information to improve his constituents’ lives.”</p><p>Amanda Litman, a co-founder and the president of Run for Something, oversees a national recruitment effort to help progressives run for downballot office. On Tuesday, the organization had 222 candidates in general elections across the country. “Nearly every candidate who won an election for municipal or state legislative office was talking about affordability, especially as it relates to housing,” she told me. “Housing is the No. 1 issue we’ve seen people bring up as a reason to run for office this year.”</p><p>The affordability approach has several strengths. Because it is a prompt rather than a policy, it allows Democrats to be organized in their thematic positioning but heterodox in their policies. A socialist can run on affordability in a blue city and win with socialist policies; a moderate can run on affordability in a purple state and win with the sort of supply-side reforms for housing and energy that animate the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/abundance-americas-next-political-order/682069/?utm_source=feed\">abundance movement</a>. At a time when Democrats are screaming at one another online and off about populism versus moderation, the affordability tent allows them to be diverse yet united: They can run on tying Trump to the affordability crisis while creating messages fit for their respective electorates.</p><p data-id=\"injected-recirculation-link\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/zohran-mamdani-campaign-slop/684842/?utm_source=feed\">Read: An antidote to shamelessness</a>]</i></p><p>This next bit is a little speculative, but another advantage of centering affordability may be that it is easier for members of a political coalition to negotiate on material politics than on post-material politics. Put differently, economic disagreements within a group are more likely to produce debate and even compromise, whereas cultural disagreements are more likely to produce purity tests and excommunication. If a YIMBY left-centrist and a democratic socialist disagree about the correct balance of price controls and supply-side reforms to reduce housing inflation in New York City, that might lead to a <a href=\"https://www.derekthompson.org/p/what-speaks-to-me-about-abundance\">perfectly pleasant conversation</a>. But perfectly pleasant conversations between political commentators about, say, ICE deportations or trans women in college sports don’t seem common. If this is true, it would suggest that the spotlight of Democratic attention shifting toward affordability might ameliorate the culture of progressive purity tests in a way that would make for a bigger tent.</p><p>Affordability politics also poses a distinct challenge. At the national level, Democrats do not have their hands on the price levers, and they won’t for at least four more calendar years. Even if they did, the best ways to reduce prices at the national level include higher interest rates (painful), meaningful spending cuts (excruciating), or a national tax increase (dial 911). Even at the local level, affordability politics in an age of elevated inflation, rapidly growing AI, and complex impediments to affordable housing can easily promise too much—or, to be more exact, offer a set of dangerously falsifiable promises.</p><p>Affordability politics thrives because of the specificity and clarity of its pledge: <i>Prices are too high; I’ll fix it if you give me power</i>. But politics isn’t just about the words you put on your bumper stickers; it’s about what you do if the bumper stickers work. Building houses takes time, even after reducing barriers to development and improving access to financing. Actually lowering prices can take even longer. Energy inflation is a bear of a problem, with transmission prices rising and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/10/data-centers-ai-crash/684765/?utm_source=feed\">data-center construction exploding</a>. After Americans learn whose affordability messages win at the ballot box, they’ll learn whose affordability policies actually work and (perhaps) keep them in office.</p><p>Affordability is good politics, and a Democratic Party that focuses on affordability at the national level, and supports motley approaches to solving the cost-of-living crisis at the local level, is in a strong position going into 2026. But saying the word <i>affordability</i> over and over doesn’t necessarily guarantee good policy outcomes. In fact, it doesn’t guarantee anything. Which is why at some point on the road back to relevance, the Democratic Party needs to become obsessed with not only winning back power but also <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Progress-Takes-Ezra-Klein/dp/1668023482\">governing effectively in the places where they have it</a>.</p><hr><p><small><i>This article was adapted from </i><a href=\"https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-democrats-new-formula-the-affordability\"><i>a post</i></a> <i>on Derek Thompson’s Substack.</i></small></p>",

    "title": "Why Am I Doing the Thinking for You?",
    "link": "https://terriblesoftware.org/2026/02/02/why-am-i-doing-the-thinking-for-you/",
    "content": "\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I got a Slack message the other week, just <em>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</em> with a link to a Notion document.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No context or indication of what this person actually believed. Just a link and a question mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I stared at it for a minute, trying to decide if I was annoyed or just tired (both, probably).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What&#8217;s this message is actually saying is: <em>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t figured this out yet and I&#8217;d like you to do the thinking for me.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sounds harsh, but it&#8217;s true. When you ask someone &#8220;what do you think?&#8221; without sharing what <em>you</em> think, you&#8217;re not collaborating, but more like outsourcing? You&#8217;re taking all the work you should have done (reading <em>and understanding</em> the doc, weighing the trade-offs, forming an opinion) and dumping it on someone else&#8217;s lap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It looks like a question, but it&#8217;s more like a task assignment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And yes, I&#8217;ve done this too. We all have. It feels polite. You&#8217;re inviting input! Except that&#8217;s not really what&#8217;s going on. What&#8217;s usually going on is one of two things:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You didn&#8217;t read/understand the freaking document, or&#8230;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You did read it and have an opinion about it, but don&#8217;t want to commit to it. What if you&#8217;re wrong? What if someone more senior disagrees? What if you look like you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing? Framing it as a question feels safer. So you wrap it in a question and let someone else take the risk.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both are problematic in the same way, because you&#8217;re literally creating work for someone else. Now they have to: understand the context, think through the options, make a judgment call, and put their name on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"></ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That&#8217;s a lot of cognitive work to offload onto someone because you didn&#8217;t want to stake a position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it slows everything down. How many threads are open right now at your company&#8217;s Slack because of this? Everyone asking questions, everyone waiting. Dozens of replies, somehow ending with less clarity than the thread started with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let me you show the better way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Don&#8217;t:</strong><br><em>&#8220;Hey, what do you think about the API versioning approach?&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Do:</strong><br><em>&#8220;Been looking at this, I think we should go with REST. The team knows it, latency isn&#8217;t tight enough to justify gRPC, and GraphQL feels like overkill for three endpoints. Going to start on this Friday unless you see something I&#8217;m missing.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That second message has everything:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A clear <strong>recommendation</strong> with reasoning</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>alternatives</strong> you considered and why you ruled them out</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <strong>deadline</strong> that assumes approval unless someone objects</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It transforms <em>&#8220;help me think&#8221;</em> into <em>&#8220;check my thinking.&#8221;</em> One creates work. The other respects people&#8217;s time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some people worry this comes across as overstepping. Like they&#8217;re being presumptuous by having opinions. I used to think this too. Turns out, it&#8217;s backwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">People don&#8217;t want to do your thinking for you (what a surprise!). They want to react to something concrete. Give them a position and they can say &#8220;sounds good&#8221; in two seconds or push back with specifics. Give them a vague question and they have to do a bunch of work before they can even respond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/11/25/what-actually-makes-you-senior/\">Reducing ambiguity</a> is one of the most valuable things you can do on a team. And one of the simplest ways to do it is to just… say what you think. Even when you&#8217;re not sure. Even when you might be wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">&#8220;But what if I don&#8217;t have enough context to have an opinion?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then say that. <em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have full visibility here, but based on what I know, I&#8217;d lean toward X, does that match what you&#8217;re seeing?&#8221;</em> Still a position, still doing some of the work, still way better than a naked question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A clear position gives people something to rally around or push back against. That&#8217;s how decisions actually get made, fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Next time you&#8217;re about to type &#8220;what do you think?&#8221;, stop. Figure out what <em>you</em> think first. Write that instead. Add your reasoning, your alternatives, and an assumed path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You&#8217;re not being pushy (even in Canada), you&#8217;re doing your job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It feels a little more exposed. A little more on the line. But that&#8217;s what moving things forward actually looks like.</p>\n",

The notion (pun-intended) that you can offload your thinking to a perfectly organized system of notes and links has always struck me as a fantasy. The people I know who&apos;ve built elaborate Notion databases or Obsidian vaults mostly end up with digital hoarding problems, where the system becomes the work. And I&apos;m broadly skeptical of the Claude Code productivity discourse, the idea that AI tools will let you 10x your output if you prompt them correctly. (Most people using AI are producing more stuff faster without any clear sense of whether the stuff is good or consistent or even pointed in the right direction.)</p><p>But I do believe in something adjacent to both of these ideas, something that borrows from the second brain concept without the hoarding, and from AI tooling without the context-free prompting: <em>I believe in coherence as a system.</em></p><p>In 1937, the British economist Ronald Coase asked a question that seems almost embarrassingly simple: why do firms exist at all? If markets are so efficient at allocating resources, why don&apos;t we just have billions of individuals contracting with each other for every task? Why do we need these hulking organizational structures called companies?</p><p>His answer, which eventually won him a Nobel Prize, was transaction costs. It&apos;s expensive to negotiate contracts and coordinate with strangers, to monitor performance and enforce agreements. Firms exist because sometimes it&apos;s cheaper to bring activities inside an organization than to contract for them on the open market. The boundary of the firm, Coase argued, sits wherever the cost of internal coordination equals the cost of external transaction.</p><p>This was a brilliant insight in &apos;37, but Coase couldn&apos;t have anticipated what happens when transaction costs collapse. When software eats coordination. When a single person with the right tools can do what used to require a department. When AI can execute tasks that once demanded teams of specialists.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/books-and-chapters/economics-transformative-ai/coasean-singularity-demand-supply-and-market-design-ai-agents?ref=joanwestenberg.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">We&apos;re in a Coasean inversion</a>. The economics that made large firms necessary are reversing. But most people are looking at this transformation through the wrong lens. They see AI as a productivity tool, a way to do more faster. They measure success in hours saved or output multiplied, and this misses the point entirely.</p><p>The solopreneur&apos;s advantage is not solely speed, and it&apos;s certainly not &quot;lower costs&quot; despite what a good too many seem to think. </p><p>The advantage is coherence.</p><h2 id=\"what-coherence-actually-means\">what coherence actually means</h2><p>When I say coherence, I mean something specific: the degree to which every part of an operation derives from the same understanding, the same model of reality and set of priorities and tradeoffs.</p><p>When you work alone, you have a problem and you understand the context because you lived it and touched it and experienced it first-hand. You make a decision based on that understanding, execute the decision, see the results, and update your understanding. The entire loop happens inside one mind.</p><p>What happens in a large organization facing the same problem? Someone identifies the problem, but they don&apos;t have authority to solve it. They write a report explaining the problem to someone who does have authority. That person reads the report, but they don&apos;t have the original context, so they ask clarifying questions. The answers come back, filtered through email or a meeting. A decision gets made, but the people who have to implement it weren&apos;t in the room. They recieve instructions that encode the decision but not the reasoning. They execute the instructions as best they understand them. The results come back through multiple layers of reporting. By the time the original decision-maker sees what happened, months have passed and the context has shifted again.</p><p>This is the basic challenge of coordination across minds. Every handoff loses information, every translation introduces drift, and every layer of abstraction moves further from ground truth.</p><p>Organizations have spent decades trying to solve this problem. They&apos;ve built elaborate systems of documentation, standardized processes, metrics and KPIs, regular meetings, shared values statements, company cultures. All of these are attempts to create coherence across minds. And they all fail, in different ways and to different degrees, because they&apos;re fighting against something that won&apos;t budge: knowledge is sticky and context is lossy, and understanding doesn&apos;t transfer perfectly between humans.</p><h2 id=\"the-pathology-of-process-drift\">the pathology of process drift</h2><p>A company starts small, with the founders doing everything themselves. They make decisions quickly because they understand everything about the business, and the business works.</p><p>The company grows and the founders can&apos;t do everything anymore. They hire people and try to transfer their understanding. But understanding doesn&apos;t transfer easily, so they also transfer processes. &quot;This is how we do X. Use this checklist for Y. Follow these steps.&quot;</p><p>The processes work, mostly. But the new employees don&apos;t have the context that generated those processes. They don&apos;t know why step three comes before step four, and they don&apos;t know which parts are essential and which parts were arbitrary choices. So when situations arise that the process doesn&apos;t quite cover, they either follow the process rigidly and get suboptimal results, or they improvise and create inconsistency.</p><p>More growth, more employees, more processes. The processes start interacting in ways nobody anticipated. The sales process assumes certain things about the product process. The product process assumes certain things about the engineering process. When those assumptions drift out of alignment, you get friction and delays and finger-pointing.</p><p>The company responds by adding coordination mechanisms like project managers, alignment meetings, and cross-functional reviews. These help, but they also add overhead, and they create their own drift: the coordination layer develops its own processes, its own assumptions, its own information loss.</p><p>Eventually you reach a point where a significant fraction of the organization&apos;s energy goes toward internal coordination rather than actual value creation. A 2022 Microsoft study found that employees in large organizations spend over 50% of their time on internal communication and coordination. Half the payroll, dedicated to getting the organization to agree with itself.</p><h2 id=\"context-fragmentation\">context fragmentation</h2><p>More information means the coordination problem gets worse, not better. This seems counterintuitive, because shouldn&apos;t more information make everyone more aligned?</p><p>But <em>information isn&apos;t understanding.</em> Understanding = integration, and integration happens in minds. More information means more raw material that each mind has to process differently.</p><p>A typical large organization&apos;s knowledge base is spilling over with strategy documents from last year and the year before, project postmortems from dozens of initiatives, customer research reports, competitive analyses, technical specifications, meeting notes, email threads, Slack channels, and wiki pages. </p><p>Somewhere in there (the elusive somewhere...) is everything you need to know to make a good decision.</p><p>But nobody has synthesized it all, and nobody has integrated it into a coherent model. Each person reads a fragment, interprets it through their own context, and forms their own understanding. When they discuss decisions with colleagues, they&apos;re not comparing the same mental models but rather different interpretations of different subsets of the available information.</p><p>This is context fragmentation. People don&apos;t disagree on facts; they&apos;re operating from different maps of the same territory. And because the maps are implicit, inside people&apos;s heads, nobody realizes they&apos;re not looking at the same thing.</p><p>The proliferation of AI tools in large organizations means that now each employee has their own AI assistant, trained on whatever context they happen to feed it, producing outputs that reflect their particular understanding of the situation. The AI amplifies individual perspectives rather than creating shared ones.</p><h2 id=\"single-player-mode-advantage\">single-player mode advantage</h2><p>When you&apos;re operating alone, you have one context, one understanding, one model of your business and your market and your customers and your strategy. That model lives in your head, and it&apos;s coherent because there&apos;s only one mind maintaining it.</p><p>If // when you use AI tools, you&apos;re feeding them from that single source of truth. The AI doesn&apos;t have its own understanding that might drift from yours, and it operates within the context you provide. If you give it good context, it executes within that context. If your understanding is coherent, the AI&apos;s outputs will be coherent.</p><p>This is the inversion of the traditional organization&apos;s problem. In a large organization, you have many minds with their own contexts, trying to coordinate through AI tools that amplify their differences. As a solo operator, you have one mind with one context, using AI tools to execute within that coherent frame.</p><p>The AI handles the execution at scale while you maintain the coherence. This division of labor plays to the strengths of each party: humans are good at integration and judgment, while AI is good at execution and volume. The solo operator with AI gets the benefits of scale without the costs of coordination.</p><p>But this only works if you actually maintain coherence. </p><p>If you&apos;re using AI to do random shit faster, you&apos;re not capturing the advantage.

Your operating model, your constraints and tradeoffs, your voice guidelines, your decision history. This layer translates what&apos;s in your head into something machines can work with.</p><p>Below that is the execution layer, where AI operates.

The mind layer feeds the context layer through deliberate documentation, the context layer constrains the execution layer through careful prompting, and the output layer feeds back to the mind layer through review, which sometimes triggers updates to your understanding.</p><p>Most people using AI skip the context layer entirely. They go straight from a vague intention to an AI prompt to shipped output.

If it&apos;s longer than a page, you haven&apos;t distilled it enough. The goal is compression without loss of generative power.</p><p>Next, build your constraints file. These are the decision-making rails that keep outputs on track. I think of them as principles // functional rules that generate answers.</p><p>For example: &quot;When choosing between comprehensive and focused, choose focused. Our readers are busy and will bounce if they don&apos;t get value in the first paragraph.&quot; That&apos;s a constraint that actually constrains, telling the AI (and me) how to resolve a common tradeoff.</p><p>Include examples. Point to a piece you wrote that exemplifies the voice, and one that doesn&apos;t. Concrete examples communicate more than abstract descriptions.</p><p>Finally, maintain a decision log. When you make a significant choice, write down what you decided and why. This creates institutional memory for a one-person institution. When similar situations arise later, you (or your AI tools) can refrence how you&apos;ve handled them before. This prevents the common failure mode where you decide the same question differently each time because you forgot your previous reasoning.</p><h2 id=\"a-coherence-check\">a coherence check</h2><p>Every output that ships should pass through a coherence check.

You ask AI to do something without feeding it your operating model, your constraints, your voice. The AI does its best, but it&apos;s working from generic training rather than your specific understanding. The output is competent but not coherent.</li><li>Output accumulation is context starvation&apos;s downstream consequence. You ship AI outputs without proper review, and each one is slightly off from your model. The deviations accumulate. After a few months, your operation no longer reflects your understanding because most of what you&apos;ve shipped wasn&apos;t actually generated from your understanding.</li><li>Model staleness happens when your understanding evolves but your context documents don&apos;t. You learn something that changes how you think about the business, but you don&apos;t propagate that update to your operating model or constraints file. Now your AI tools are working from an outdated picture.</li><li>Fragmented tooling = using different AI tools with different contexts. You use one tool for writing and another for code and another for research, and each has different context, different prompts, different understandings of what you&apos;re doing. The outputs don&apos;t cohere because they&apos;re not coming from the same source.</li><li>Decision amnesia = making choices without recording the reasoning. You decide something, move on, and three months later face a similar choice with no memory of how you handled it before. You decide differently this time. Now you have inconsistent decisions in your history, and any AI tool referencing your past work will find contradictions.</li></ul><h2 id=\"the-fragmentation-audit\">the fragmentation audit</h2><p>You should audit your operation for coherence as often as possible. I do this monthly, AI tools or not, AI be damned, but the frequency matters less than doing it at all.</p><p>Pull your last twenty or thirty outputs, whether blog posts, emails, product updates, or whatever you&apos;ve shipped. Lay them out and look for the implied beliefs and positions in each. What does this piece assume about the reader? What does it prioritize, and what stance does it take?</p><p>You&apos;re looking for drift: places where piece A assumes one thing and piece B assumes something different, places where your voice shifted without intention, places where you contradicted yourself purely because you genuinely forgot what you&apos;d said before.</p><p>When you find inconsistencies, you have two options. Either reconcile them by updating your model (maybe you actually did change your mind, and the recent piece reflects your current thinking), or flag them as errors and correct going forward.</p><p>This audit also reveals context layer gaps. If you keep finding drift in a particular area, your context documents probably don&apos;t cover that area well enough. Add constraints, add examples, make the implicit explicit.</p><h2 id=\"why-this-beats-scale\">why this beats scale</h2><p>Large organizations have obvious advantages. They have capital, they have brand recognition, distribution, expertise, redundancy, Las Vegas conferences etc. A solo operator can&apos;t compete on those dimensions.</p><p>But think what those advantages actually buy. Capital lets you hire more people, and more people means more coordination overhead and context fragmentation. Brand recognition helps customers find you, but it doesn&apos;t help you serve them coherently. Distribution gets your product to more places, but each touchpoint introduces opportunities for inconsistency. Expertise is great, but experts in different domains don&apos;t automaticaly share mental models.</p><p>Meanwhile, the solo operator with a coherent system has advantages that don&apos;t show up on traditional metrics. Every customer interaction comes from the same understanding, and every piece of content reflects the same perspective. Every product decision follows from the same model. The operation feels like one thing, because it is one thing.</p><p>Customers experience this as quality, even if they can&apos;t articulate why. They sense that someone understands what they&apos;re doing and why, and they don&apos;t encounter the cognitive dissonance of dealing with an organization that can&apos;t agree with itself.</p><p>The dynamic that makes this sustainable is that <em>coherence compounds</em>. Each decision you make within your model reinforces the model, and each output that reflects your understanding strengthens your position. Your operation becomes more legible over time, both to you and to your customers. Meanwhile, large organizations&apos; incoherence also compounds, with each misalignment creating more misalignment and each process drift opening space for more drift.</p><p>The gap widens.</p><p>The coherence advantage works best in domains where the value comes from understanding rather than from physical or regulatory scale. Knowledge work, creative work, advisory work, software, content, education, consulting. These are domains where a coherent perspective can outcompete a fragmented organization&apos;s superior resources.</p><p>And the opportunity is unique: the technology exists to operate at scale while maintaining the coherence of a single mind. The window is open because large organizations haven&apos;t figured out how to respond. Their answer to AI so far has been to give everyone AI tools and hope for productivity gains, which accelerates their fragmentation...</p><h2 id=\"the-coherence-moat\">the coherence moat</h2><p>Scale used to be the moat. You built a big organization with lots of resources, and the sheer weight of your operation protected you from smaller competitors. Transaction costs made it hard for anyone to replicate what you&apos;d built.</p><p>But transaction costs are collapsing. The activities that used to require organizations can increasingly be performed by individuals with the right tools.</p><p>The Coasean logic that justified large firms is weakening.</p><p>If there is a new moat (and I&apos;ll admit, that&apos;s a big &quot;if&quot;) it probably looks like coherence; the ability to operate as one mind, one understanding, one model, even as you execute at scale. Large organizations can&apos;t have this because they&apos;re composed of many minds. Solo operators can have it by default, if they&apos;re deliberate about maintaining it.</p><p>The solo operator who builds a coherent system and lets AI execute within it has an advantage that doesn&apos;t need venture capital, doesn&apos;t need hiring, and doesn&apos;t ask for the whole apparatus of organizational scaling.</p><p>Scale breaks coherence. Coherence is the moat.</p>",

Infiltrators.</h2><p>Signal is a usable, secure, encrypted messaging app. The tech is solid. That said, there are still two ways that Signal groups get compromised:</p><ul><li><strong>Someone&apos;s device gets searched.</strong> This typically happens after they get arrested, or searched at a border crossing or other security checkpoint, or their home or office is raided. See <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/practical-defenses-against-technofascism/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Practical Defenses Against Technofascism</a> for some advise on dealing with this.</li><li><strong>Or an infiltrator joins the group.</strong></li></ul><p>Infiltrators join groups with lax permissions. Or, uh, maybe <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/we-are-currently-clean-on-opsec-the-signalgate-saga/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Trump&apos;s national security advisor just adds them</a>.</p><p>If you&apos;re not familiar with how Signal group links and permissions work, check out <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/using-signal-groups-for-activism/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Using Signal groups for activism</a>. Some groups have group links on and anyone with the link can join. Others might allow anyone in the group to invite anyone else.</p><p>With large groups &#x2013; a requirement for mass movements &#x2013; group permissions like these make it easy for new people to get involved. But at the same time, they also make it a lot easier for infiltrators to snake their way in.</p><p>Because of the risk of infiltrators, it&apos;s common &#x2013; and in many cases a good idea &#x2013; to not put your real name in your Signal profile.</p><p>If a single infiltrator sneaks in, they&apos;ll get access to a list of everyone in the group.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/\">FOSDEM 2026</a> ran last weekend in Brussels with its usual dense schedule of talks across open source projects and communities. Package management had a strong presence again this year, with a <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/package-management/\">dedicated devroom</a> plus related content scattered across the <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/distributions/\">Distributions</a>, <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/nix-and-nixos/\">Nix and NixOS</a>, and <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/sboms-and-supply-chains/\">SBOMs and Supply Chains</a> tracks.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"main-track-talks\">Main Track Talks</h2>\n\n<p>Kenneth Hoste presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DCAVDC-how_to_make_package_managers_scream/\">How to Make Package Managers Scream</a>, a follow-up to his FOSDEM 2018 talk about making package managers cry. Hoste showcased creative and effective ways open source software projects take things to the next level to make package managers scream, along with tools that try to counter these practices.</p>\n\n<p>Mike McQuaid gave <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/YUJUKD-what_happened_to_rubygems_and_what_can_we_learn/\">What happened to RubyGems and what can we learn?</a> examining the February 2024 RubyGems and Bundler infrastructure incident.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"package-management-devroom\">Package Management Devroom</h2>\n\n<p>The Package Management devroom, which I organized with Wolf Vollprecht, ran on Saturday with nine talks covering security, standards, and practical implementation challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Adam Harvey opened with <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/GFA3RJ-a_phishy_case_study/\">A phishy case study</a> about the September 2024 phishing attack on crates.io. The attack targeted popular crate owners as part of a wider campaign across language ecosystems. Harvey detailed how the Rust Project, Rust Foundation, and Alpha-Omega collaborated to mitigate it rapidly. Mike Fiedler\n<a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@miketheman/116008792409955286\">posted a follow-up on Mastodon</a> describing how attackers were able to circumvent 2FA.\nIn short, TOTP 2FA does not include phishing resistance (compared to WebAuthn or Passkeys), so the TOTP codes can be collected and forwarded\nto the target service the same way that passwords are.</p>\n\n<p>Zach Steindler presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/BCFZP7-current-state-programming-language-attestations/\">Current state of attestations in programming language ecosystems</a>, comparing how npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and Maven Central have implemented attestations over the past few years. These attestations provide build provenance by linking packages to exact source code and build instructions, distributed as Sigstore bundles. Steindler covered the APIs for accessing attestations in each ecosystem and discussed implementation tradeoffs.</p>\n\n<p>Gábor Boskovits explored <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/BJCN93-name-resolution-in-package-managers/\">Name resolution in package management systems - A reproducibility perspective</a>, comparing how different systems handle package dependencies. He looked at language-specific package managers with lock files (Cargo), typical distributions (Debian), and functional package managers (Nix and Guix), then reflected on these approaches from a reproducible builds angle.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Gibb presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/3SANYS-package-managers-a-la-carte/\">Package managers à la carte: A Formal Model of Dependency Resolution</a>, introducing the Package Calculus. This formalism aims to unify the core semantics of diverse package managers, showing how real-world features reduce to the core calculus. Gibb demonstrated Pac, a language for translating between distinct package managers and performing dependency resolution across ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew Suozzo gave <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/EP8AMW-oss-rebuild-observability/\">Trust Nothing, Trace Everything: Auditing Package Builds at Scale with OSS Rebuild</a>. While reproducible builds confirm artifacts match expectations, they treat the build process as a black box. OSS Rebuild instruments the build environment to detect malicious behavior in real-time using a transparent network proxy for uncovering hidden remote dependencies and an eBPF-based system analyzer for examining build behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Philippe Ombredanne returned with <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/P8AAT3-purl/\">PURL: From FOSDEM 2018 to international standard</a>. Package-URL was <a href=\"https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/purl/\">first presented at FOSDEM</a> eight years ago and has now become an international standard for referencing packages across ecosystems. Ombredanne highlighted PURL’s adoption in CVE format, security tools, and SCA platforms, and its journey from community project to Ecma standard with plans for ISO standardization.</p>\n\n<p>Vlad-Stefan Harbuz spoke about <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/7NQJNU-binary_dependencies_identifying_the_hidden_packages_we_all_depend_on/\">Binary Dependencies: Identifying the Hidden Packages We All Depend On</a>, examining dependencies that don’t appear in standard package manager manifests. Related: <a href=\"/2026/01/27/the-c-shaped-hole-in-package-management.html\">the C-shaped hole in package management</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Winser discussed <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/8WJKEH-package-registry-economics/\">The terrible economics of package registries and how to fix them</a>, looking at the sustainability challenges facing package registry infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Mike McQuaid closed the devroom with <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/FGBYKV-package_management_learnings_from_homebrew/\">Package Management Learnings from Homebrew</a>, covering lessons from 16 years of maintaining Homebrew and the recent v5.0.0 release.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"distributions-devroom\">Distributions Devroom</h2>\n\n<p>The Distributions devroom on Sunday covered 16 talks about building and maintaining Linux distributions.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Mellado and Mikel Olasagasti tackled <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/VSXPA8-packaging-ebpf-in-linux-distros/\">Packaging eBPF Programs in a Linux Distribution: Challenges &amp; Solutions</a>. eBPF introduces unique challenges including kernel dependencies, CO-RE relocations, pinning behavior, and version-aligned tooling. They explored specific issues in Fedora like pinned maps, privilege models, reproducible builds, SELinux implications, and managing kernel updates.</p>\n\n<p>František Lachman and Cristian Le presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/MCNHUF-from-code-to-distribution-testing-pipeline/\">From Code to Distribution: Building a Complete Testing Pipeline</a> about the Packaging and Testing Experience (PTE) project. The project bridges upstream-to-downstream testing with tmt (test management framework), Testing Farm (on-demand test infrastructure), and Packit (integration glue).</p>\n\n<p>Robin Candau discussed <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/FFWA7E-transparent-sources-for-arch-linux-packages/\">Relying on more transparent &amp; trustworthy sources for Arch Linux packages</a>. Recent supply chain attacks prompted Arch Linux to establish updated guidelines for selecting trustworthy package sources to prevent or mitigate security threats.</p>\n\n<p>Fabio Valentini presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/HZFHZV-distributing-rust-in-rpms-for-fun-and-profit/\">Distributing Rust in RPMs for fun (relatively speaking) and profit</a>, covering his work as the main maintainer of Rust packages in Fedora and primary developer of the tooling for packaging Rust crates as RPMs.</p>\n\n<p>Till Wegmüller discussed <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/3M7TRM-illumos-ips-a-different-system-package-manager/\">(Re)Building a next gen system package Manager and Image management tool</a> about IPS (Image Packaging System), a component from OpenSolaris used extensively in OpenIndiana. Wegmüller covered IPS history, current capabilities, core concepts including repositories, packages, FMRI, facets, variants, and manifests, plus plans to <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/OpenIndiana-Next-Gen-IPS\">port IPS to Rust</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"nix-and-nixos-devroom\">Nix and NixOS Devroom</h2>\n\n<p>The Nix devroom on Saturday packed in 19 talks about the functional package manager and operating system.</p>\n\n<p>Philippe Ombredanne presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/EBPDES-nixpkgs-clarity/\">Nixpkgs Clarity: Correcting Nix package license metadata</a> on improving package license metadata quality.</p>\n\n<p>Julien Malka and Arnout Engelen introduced <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/HGC788-lila_decentralized_reproducible-builds_verification_for_the_nixos_ecosystem/\">LILA: decentralized reproducible-builds verification for the NixOS ecosystem</a>, a system for verifying reproducible builds across the Nix ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>TheComputerGuy spoke about <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/8SNMXT-describing_nix_closures_using_sboms/\">Describing Nix closures using SBOMs</a>, bridging Nix’s dependency model with SBOM standards.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Gibb also presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ERQ8FQ-opam-nix/\">Opam’s Nix system dependency mechanism</a>, exploring how OCaml’s opam package manager integrates with Nix for system dependencies.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sboms-and-supply-chains\">SBOMs and Supply Chains</h2>\n\n<p>Philippe Ombredanne and Steve Springett presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DRGX73-purl/\">Forget SBOMs, use PURLs</a> in the SBOMs and supply chains devroom, arguing that Package URLs provide a more practical foundation for identifying software components than full SBOMs in many contexts.</p>\n\n<p>Karen Bennet discussed <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/9Q9EEL-what_is_new_in_spdx_3_1_which_is_now_a_living_knowledge_graph/\">What is new in SPDX 3.1 which is now a Living Knowledge Graph</a>, covering the latest SPDX specification updates and its evolution into a knowledge graph model.</p>\n\n<p>Ariadne Conill presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ELPHEA-pkgconf-sbom/\">C/C++ Build-time SBOMs with pkgconf</a>, showing how to generate SBOMs during the build process for C/C++ projects.</p>\n\n<p>Ev Cheng and Sam Khouri spoke about <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/MAL9ZQ-swiftpm-sboms/\">Enhancing Swift’s Supply Chain Security: Build-time SBOM Generation in Swift Package Manager</a>, demonstrating similar capabilities for Swift.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hpc-and-scientific-computing\">HPC and Scientific Computing</h2>\n\n<p>Harmen Stoppels presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DHUQAN-spack-one-zero-and-beyond/\">Spack v1.0 and Beyond: Managing HPC Software Stacks</a>, covering the first stable release of Spack, a package manager for supercomputers that now handles builds for systems with tens of thousands of cores.</p>\n\n<p>Ludovic Courtès spoke about <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/QKNMJN-package-management-in-the-hands-of-users/\">Package management in the hands of users: dream and reality</a>, discussing Guix deployment in high-performance computing environments.</p>\n\n<p>Helena Vela Beltran gave <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/RQD9AD-status-update-eessi/\">Status update on EESSI, the European Environment for Scientific Software Installations</a>, covering the project that builds on EasyBuild and Spack to provide a shared software stack for HPC systems across Europe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-tracks\">Other Tracks</h2>\n\n<p>The Python track included Jarek Potiuk’s <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/WE7NHM-modern-python-monorepo-apache-airflow/\">Modern Python monorepo with uv, workspaces, prek and shared libraries</a>, covering uv, the new Python package manager that’s been gaining adoption.</p>\n\n<p>Simon Josefsson presented <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ZELSB8-guix-containers/\">Guix Container Images -

The American Housing Company is a new, vertically integrated housing startup that plans to design, build, and sell or rent modular homes aimed specifically at families. There&#8217;s a few interesting things about their approach: they&#8217;re acting as both the builder and the developer, instead of trying to sell their homes to existing developers. And they&#8217;re using Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs), something I&#8217;ve always thought of as an underrated building technology.

[<a href=\"https://www.ternerlabs.org/housing-venture-lab\">Terner Labs</a>]</p><h4>Manufacturing</h4><p>One of the most potent criticisms of tariffs is that they actually harm manufacturing by raising the costs of manufacturing inputs. In that vein, aluminum in the US used to be roughly the same price as in Europe and Japan, but starting in 2025 it diverged. &#8220;The regional premium for aluminum delivered to the US market climbed above $1 a pound for the first time as US President Donald Trump&#8217;s tariffs make the metal more expensive in the domestic market.&#8221;

(For the uninitiated: Think of it kind of like swiping between virtual desktops on Windows or MacOS, except you can do it on every single window, slideshow-style.) It was the best of both worlds—easy to navigate, while remaining mousable.</p><p>Eventually more people figured out that this was the ticket, and now PaperWM has grown from quiet experiment to robust extension. As a way to prove an idea, it was basically flawless, to the point where <a href=\"https://github.com/mogenson/PaperWM.spoon\">someone made a MacOS version</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/0C0qYpwP8n_eHZLfMLztidHSRWE=/2560x1440/filters:quality(80)/uploads/PaperWM.jpg\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PaperWM.jpg\" /><figcaption>A screenshot of PaperWM, quietly one of the most exciting interface innovations of the past decade.</figcaption></figure><p>But it had a problem: It was attached to <a href=\"https://www.gnome.org\">GNOME</a>, with all the extra cruft that implies. GNOME’s interface has a lot of fans (me included), but it’s mature, complex, and prescriptive. It’s controversial in the Linux world because it makes UX decisions for users that sometimes get in the way of user choice. I tend to defend it, but if you were to put “heavy FOSS graphical interface” in the dictionary, GNOME would most assuredly show up.</p><p>Retrofitting a new user interface paradigm on top of that dynamic comes with compromises.</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/vXUzMp2F9wWKgd9anr0SBeLjgLw=/1000x723/filters:quality(80)/uploads/niri-star.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"niri-star.jpg\" /><figcaption>If you want to think about things in terms of GitHub stars, Hyprland is growing fast, but Niri is starting to catch up.</figcaption></figure><p>Which is why I’ve been keeping an eye on <a href=\"https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri\">niri</a>, an emerging window manager that is doing for sliding windows what <a href=\"https://hypr.land\">Hyprland</a> did for tiling. It is less than three years old (Hyprland is about four), but has quickly grown in popularity, <a href=\"https://www.star-history.com/#YaLTeR/niri&amp;hyprwm/Hyprland&amp;type=date&amp;legend=top-left\">doubling its GitHub star count</a> in the past six months.</p><p>Built around the Wayland compositor, the project basically is set up like a kit, one where you need to supply parts in the form of config files. If you like customizing, it may be the project for you. But if you just want to get stuff done, it might not feel like a welcoming experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://tedium.co/2025/10/13/omarchy-linux-distro-commentary/\">Omarchy</a>, which we (controversially) covered a few months ago, exists because of this gap. People want the lightweight customizability of a window manager, but not the work of having to set it up.</p><p>To be clear, this is not far from where graphical interfaces for Linux and Unix variants started 40 years ago, but it’s arguably making a comeback because of a combination of sophisticated users and sophisticated tools. But not everyone has time to build their own config files from scratch.</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/uYXMVYlFTT5co6jvsW37CQD9dCg=/1000x625/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Niri-DankMaterialShell.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Niri-DankMaterialShell.jpg\" /><figcaption>My setup, combining Niri and the DankMaterialShell.</figcaption></figure><p>That’s where the project <a href=\"https://danklinux.com\">Dank Linux</a> comes in. Pitched as a “modern desktop for Wayland,” it’s a set of “batteries included” tools to get you going in Niri or other window managers based on Wayland. Key to the project is DankMaterialShell, which combines a number of tools into one interface, along with the <a href=\"https://m3.material.io\">Material design</a> approach. If Hyprland, Sway, niri and their ilk are attempts to deconstruct the desktop environment, Dank Linux tries putting it back together again.</p><p>Rather than relying on loose tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar\">waybar</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/davatorium/rofi\">rofi</a> and bringing them together with a best-in-breed approach, DankMaterialShell comes with all the necessary tools already baked in. Plus, it’s highly extensible, and can be edited through a bunch of config files, just like all the really complicated tools. But unlike Omarchy, it’s not prescriptive—you’re not just having to work around one guy’s opinion of what your UX should look like for the rest of time. (Case in point: I don’t like borders or gaps around my windows, a typical trait of scrolling window managers. So … I just removed them.)</p><p>That’s because it’s built around <a href=\"https://quickshell.org\">Quickshell</a>, a toolkit that has become very <a href=\"https://github.com/topics/quickshell\">popular as a modding tool</a> in the Linux community.</p><p>But some of us are normies who just want something that works. Hence why DankMaterialShell is making such a splash.</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/XfhtIuGhUBxyc8cVN_Eie_hvO64=/889x936/filters:quality(80)/uploads/dankmaterialshell_setup.png\" width=\"889\" height=\"936\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"dankmaterialshell_setup.png\" /><figcaption>An example of the graphical interface for DankMaterialShell. It has many of the features of the GNOME setup, including the ability to arrange monitors, with a lean on UI.</figcaption></figure><p>The feature set for this software is surprisingly robust, and seems to be growing quickly. <a href=\"https://danklinux.com/blog/v1-2-release\">DMS 1.2</a>, for example, has literally dozens of new features. And despite the fact that this tool is only about six months old, it already has a screenshot tool, numerous plugins, and a robust theming system. The momentum is clearly there. (It’s not alone, either—also covering the same territory is <a href=\"https://noctalia.dev\">Noctalia</a>, which promises a more relaxed aesthetic.)</p><p>The Dank Linux team offers a couple of optional utilities—the system overview tool DGOP and the MacOS Spotlight-like file tool dsearch—that can make the experience surprisingly polished.</p><p>The one downside of this is that Dank Linux isn’t really supported on Bazzite, the very popular distro I use. But after I mentioned I was interested in that, and I did some off-label testing on my end, one of the creators of <a href=\"https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium/\">Zirconium</a>, a Dank Linux distro for Fedora, reached out. Turns out, they were already working on a “quick and dirty” image that got Bazzite working with Zirconium. (As reflected by the name, <a href=\"https://github.com/bazzirco/bazzirco\">Bazzirco</a>.) They even created a <a href=\"https://dev.bazzite.gg\">Bazzite DX</a> version for me, so I could easily access my Docker containers from the thing.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://universal-blue.org\">Universal Blue</a>, the framework upon which Bazzite is based, allows you to make your own custom builds pretty easily. You can even roll back to other versions so you can switch between different builds at will. Think it’s gonna be a GNOME day? Switch to that image.)</p><p>There were some glitches here and there—for example, I found that turning variable refresh rate on for my laptop screen caused my external monitors to drag. Plus, running a “quick and dirty” build naturally means you’re going to run into some quick-and-dirty bugs. (I ran into some audio issues while running <em>Balatro</em> on the experimental distro. Not the end of the world.

Every single one. They span from <em>relatively</em> minor changes to complete chapter rewrites. After some rough git diffing, I think I deleted about 11,000 words?<sup id=\"fnref:gross-additions\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:gross-additions\">2</a></sup> The biggest change is probably to the Alloy chapter. After many sleepless nights, I realized the right approach wasn't to teach Alloy as a <em>data modeling</em> tool but to teach it as a <em>domain modeling</em> tool. Which technically means the book no longer covers data modeling.</p>\n<p>There's also a lot more connections between the chapters. The introductory math chapter, for example, foreshadows how each bit of math will be used in the future techniques. I also put more emphasis on the general \"themes\" like the expressiveness-guarantees tradeoff (working title). One theme I'm really excited about is compatibility (extremely working title). It turns out that the <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/the-liskov-substitution-principle-does-more-than/\" target=\"_blank\">Liskov substitution principle</a>/subtyping in general, <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/refinement-without-specification/\" target=\"_blank\">database migrations</a>, backwards-compatible API changes, and <a href=\"https://hillelwayne.com/post/refinement/\" target=\"_blank\">specification refinement</a> all follow <em>basically</em> the same general principles. I'm calling this \"compatibility\" for now but prolly need a better name.</p>\n<p>Finally, there's just a lot more new topics in the various chapters. <code>Testing</code> properly covers structural and metamorphic properties. <code>Proofs</code> covers proof by induction and proving recursive functions (in an exercise). <code>Logic Programming</code> now finally has a section on answer set programming. You get the picture.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>There's a lot I still want to add to the book: proper data modeling, data structures, type theory, model-based testing, etc. But I've added new material for two year, and if I keep going it will never get done. So with this release, all the content is in!</p>\n<p>Just like all the content was in <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/five-unusual-raku-features/\" target=\"_blank\">two Novembers ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-project-update/\" target=\"_blank\">two Januaries ago</a> and <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/logic-for-programmers-turns-one/\" target=\"_blank\">last July</a>. To make it absolutely 100% for sure that I won't be tempted to add anything else, I passed the whole manuscript over to a copy editor. So if I write more, it won't get edits. That's a pretty good incentive to stop.</p>\n<p>I also need to find a technical reviewer and proofreader. Once all three phases are done then it's \"just\" a matter of fixing the layout and finding a good printer. I don't know what the timeline looks like but I really want to have something I can hold in my hands before the summer.</p>\n<p>(I also need to get notable-people testimonials. Hampered a little in this because I'm trying real hard not to quid-pro-quo, so I'd like to avoid anybody who helped me or is mentioned in the book. And given I tapped most of my network to help me... I've got some ideas though!)</p>\n<p>There's still a lot of work ahead. Even so, for the first time in two years I don't have research to do or sections to write and it feels so crazy. Maybe I'll update my blog again! Maybe I'll run a workshop! Maybe I'll go outside if Chicago ever gets above 6°F! </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Conference Season</h2>\n<p>After a pretty slow 2025, the 2026 conference season is looking to be pretty busy!

    "title": "Some Data Should Be Code",
    "link": "https://borretti.me/article/some-data-should-be-code",
    "content": "<p>I write a lot of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)\">Makefiles</a>. I use it not as a command runner but as an ad-hoc build system for small projects, typically for compiling Markdown documents and their dependencies. Like so:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 300px;\" src=\"/assets/content/some-data-should-be-code/graph.png\" alt=\"A build graph for a document. A central node `doc.md` represents the Markdown source. Two outgoing arrows point to `doc.html` and `doc.pdf`, representing the output format. A chain through `graph.dot`, `graph.png`, and `doc.md` represets how a Graphviz .dot file can be rendered to PNG. A chain through `data.csv`, `plot.py`, `plot.png`, and `doc.md` represents using a Python script to make a plot from a CSV file.\" /></p>\n\n<p>And the above graph was generated by this very simple Makefile:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-makefile highlighter-rouge\">\n  <div class=\"highlight\">\n    <pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nl\">graph.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">graph.dot</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">dot</span> <span class=\"err\">-Tpng</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">-o</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\n\n<span class=\"nl\">clean</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">rm</span> <span class=\"err\">-f</span> <span class=\"err\">graph.png</span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>(I could never remember the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html\">automatic variable</a> syntax until I made <a href=\"https://github.com/eudoxia0/flashcards/blob/aefae3ed874627201dbcedec045095779691d323/Cards/make.md\">flashcards</a> for them.)</p>\n\n<p>It works for simple projects, when you can mostly hand-write the rules. But the abstraction ceiling is very low. If you have a bunch of almost identical rules, e.g.:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-makefile highlighter-rouge\">\n  <div class=\"highlight\">\n    <pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nl\">a.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">a.csv plot.py</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">python</span> <span class=\"err\">plot.py</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\n\n<span class=\"nl\">b.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">b.csv plot.py</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">python</span> <span class=\"err\">plot.py</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\n\n<span class=\"nl\">c.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">c.csv plot.py</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">python</span> <span class=\"err\">plot.py</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>You can use pattern-matching to them into a “rule schema”, by analogy to axiom schemata:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-makefile highlighter-rouge\">\n  <div class=\"highlight\">\n    <pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nl\">%.png</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">%.csv plot.py</span>\n    <span class=\"err\">python</span> <span class=\"err\">plot.py</span> <span class=\"err\">$&lt;</span> <span class=\"err\">$@</span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Which works backwards: when something in the build graph depends on a target matching <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">%.png</code>, Make synthesizes a rule instance with a dependency on the corresponding <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.csv</code> file.</p>\n\n<p>But pattern matching is still very limited. Lately I’ve been building my own <a href=\"https://plaintextaccounting.org/\">plain-text accounting</a> solution using some Python scripts. One of the tasks is to read a CSV of bank transactions from 2019–2024 and split it into TOML files for each year-month, to make subsequent processing parallelizable. So the rules might be something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-makefile:\">ledger/2019-08.toml: inputs/checkbook_pro_export.csv\n    uv run import_from_checkbook.py --year=2019 --month=8\n\nledger/2019-09.toml: inputs/checkbook_pro_export.csv\n    uv run import_from_checkbook.py --year=2019 --month=9\n\n# ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I had to write a Python script to generate the complete Makefile. Makefiles look like code, but are data: they are a container format for tiny fragments of shell that are run on-demand by the Make engine. And because Make doesn’t scale, for complex tasks you have to bring out a real programming language to generate the Makefile.</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could, instead, write a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">make.py</code> file with something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\">\n  <div class=\"highlight\">\n    <pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">whatever</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">g</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">BuildGraph</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">EXPORT</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"inputs/checkbook_pro_export.csv\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># The (year, month) pairs I have bank transaction CSVs for.\n</span><span class=\"n\">year_months</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">list</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">tuple</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">]]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2019</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2026</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">13</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Import transactions for each year-month into a separate ledger.\n</span><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">year</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">month</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">year_months</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">ledger_path</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"s\">\"ledger/</span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">year</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s\">_</span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">month</span><span class=\"si\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">02</span><span class=\"n\">d</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s\">.toml\"</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">g</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rule</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">targets</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ledger_path</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">deps</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">EXPORT</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">fn</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">lambda</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">import_from_checkbook</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ledger_path</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">year</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">month</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Fortunately this exists: it’s called <a href=\"https://pydoit.org/\">doit</a>, but it’s not widely known.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>A lot of things are like Makefiles: data that should be lifted one level up to become code.</p>\n\n<p>Consider <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_CloudFormation\">CloudFormation</a>. Nobody likes writing those massive YAML files by hand, so AWS introduced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_Cloud_Development_Kit\">CDK</a>, which is literally just a library<sup id=\"fnref:fn1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:fn1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> of classes that represent AWS resources. Running a CDK program emits CloudFormation YAML as though it were an assembly language for infrastructure.

Again: conditions, loops, abstraction, type safety, we get all of those for free by virtue of using a language that was designed to be a language, rather than a data exchange language that slowly grows into a poorly-designed DSL.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we repeatedly end up here? Static data has better safety/static analysis properties than code, but I don’t think that’s foremost in mind when people design these systems. Besides, using code to emit data (as CDK does) gives you those exact same properties. Rather, I think some people think it’s cute and clever to build tiny DSLs in a data format. They’re proud that they can get away with a “simple”, static solution rather than a dynamic one.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re building a new CI system/IaC platform/Make replacement: please just let me write code to dynamically create the workflow/infrastructure/build graph.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"footnotes\">Footnotes</h1>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:fn1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n\n      <p>Or rather, a polyglot collection of libraries, one per language, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulumi\">Pulumi</a>. <a href=\"#fnref:fn1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n",

It sells ERP software &#x2013; enterprise resource planning, which is a rat king of different services for giant companies for financial services, procurement (IE: sourcing and organizing the goods your company needs to run), compliance, project management, and human resources. It sells database software, and even owns the programming language <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Sun_Microsystems_by_Oracle_Corporation?ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>Java as part of its acquisition of Sun Microsystems back in 2010</u></a>.&#xA0;</p><p>Its customers are <em>fucking everyone: </em>hospitals (<a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/customers/nhssbs/?ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>such as England&#x2019;s National Health Service</u></a>), large corporations (like Microsoft), health insurance companies, Walmart, and multiple different governments. Even if you have never even heard of Oracle before, it&#x2019;s almost entirely certain that your personal data is sitting in an Oracle-designed system somewhere.&#xA0;</p><p>Once you let Oracle into your house, it never leaves. Canceling contracts is difficult, to the point that one Redditor notes that some clients agreed to spend a minimum amount of money on services without realizing, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/1duo72l/comment/lbhyi61/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\"><u>meaning that you can&#x2019;t remove services you don&#x2019;t need<em> even during the renewal of a contract</em></u></a><em>. </em><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/13kh7ks/contract_signed_with_oracle/?ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>One user from three years ago</u></a> told the story of adding two users to their contract for Oracle&#x2019;s Netsuite Starter Edition (<a href=\"https://www.kimberlitepartners.com/blog/netsuite-pricing?ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>around $1000 a month in today&#x2019;s pricing</u></a>), only for an Oracle account manager to call a day later to demand they upgrade to the more expensive package ($2500 per month) <em>for every user.</em>&#xA0;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/1fynmq0/contract_renegotiation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\"><u>In a thread from a year ago</u></a>, another user asked for help renegotiating their contract for Netsuite, adding that &#x201C;[their] company is no where near the state needed to begin an implementation&#x201D; and &#x201C;would use a third party partner to implement&#x201D; software that they had been sold by Oracle. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/1fynmq0/comment/lqw5flb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\"><u>One user responded</u></a> by saying that Oracle would play hardball and &#x201C;may even use [the] threat of attorneys.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>In fact, there are entire websites about negotiations with Oracle, <a href=\"https://palisadecompliance.com/oracle-negotiations-contract-management/?ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>with Palisade Compliance saying that</u></a> &#x201C;Oracle likes a frenetic pace where contracts are reviewed and dialogues happen under the constant pressure of Oracle&#x2019;s quarter closes,&#x201D; describing negotiations with them as &#x201C;often rushed, filled with tension, and littered with threats from aggressive sales and Oracle auditing personnel.&#x201D; This is something you can only do when you&#x2019;ve made it so incredibly difficult to change providers. What&#x2019;re you gonna do? Have your entire database not work? Pay up.</p><p>Oracle also likes to do &#x201C;audits&#x201D; of big customers where it makes sure that <em>every single part of your organization that uses Oracle software is paying for it, <strong>or were not using it in a way that was not allowed based on their contract</strong>. </em>For example, <a href=\"https://www.tacticallawgroup.com/oracle-software-audit-blog/oracle-sues-end-user-alleging-hosting-violation?ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>Oracle sued healthcare IT company Perry Johnson &amp; Associates in 2020</u></a> because <em>the company that built PJ&amp;A&#x2019;s database systems used Oracle&#x2019;s database software. </em>The case was settled.</p><p>This is all to say that Oracle is a big company that sells lots of stuff, and increases the pressure around its quarterly earnings as a means of boosting revenues. If you have a company with computers that might be running Java or Oracle&#x2019;s software &#x2014; even if somebody else installed it for you! &#x2014; you&#x2019;ll be paying Oracle, one way or another. <a href=\"https://www.panitchlaw.com/oracle-v-google-the-never-ending-case-finally-ends/?ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>They even tried to sue Google for using the open source version of Java to build its Android operating system</u></a> (though they lost).&#xA0;</p><p>Oracle is a huge, inevitable pain in the ass, and, for the most part, <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ORCL/oracle/net-income?ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>an incredibly profitable one</u></a>. Every time a new customer signs on at Oracle, they pledge themselves to the Graveyard Smash and permanent fealty to Larry Ellison&#x2019;s database empire.&#xA0;</p><p>As a result, founder Larry Ellison has become one of the richest people in the world &#x2014; <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/larry-ellison/?ctpv=rtb&amp;list=rtb&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at\"><u>the fifth-largest as of writing this sentence</u></a> &#x2014; owning 40% of Oracle&#x2019;s stock and, per Martin Peers of The Information, will earn about $2.3 billion in dividends in the next year.&#xA0;</p><p>Oracle has also done well to stay out of bullshit hype-cycles.

Per TechCrunch:</blockquote><p>Oracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to a memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.</p><p>I know that you&#x2019;re likely a little scared that an ultra right-wing billionaire has bought another major social network. I know you think that Oracle, a massive and inevitable cloud storage platform owned by a man who looks like H.R. Giger drew Jerry Stiller. I know you&#x2019;re likely worried about a replay of the Elon Musk Twitter fiasco, where every week it seemed like things would collapse but it never seemed to happen, and then Musk bought an election.</p><p>What if I told you that things were very different, <em>and far more existentially perilous</em> for Oracle?</p><h1 id=\"oracle-is-burning-billions-of-dollars-threatening-its-future-and-larry-ellison%E2%80%99s-fortune\">Oracle Is Burning Billions of Dollars, Threatening Its Future and Larry Ellison&#x2019;s Fortune</h1><p>You see, Oracle is arguably one of the single-most evil and successful companies in the world, and it&#x2019;s got there by being an aggressive vendor of database and ERP software, one that, like a tick with a law degree, cannot be removed without some degree of bloodshed.

    "content": "<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Dispatches From The Wormhole</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now surging forth into your reality: a more potent than ever Hypnoverse!</p>\n\n<p>Previously the Hypnoverse proudly represented humanity’s best efforts at \ndistracting, deceiving, and enslaving you. But this Hypnoverse was feeble, \nunable to fully subjugate its hosts. Previously the Hypnoverse depended on \nofferings from real human beings to sustain itself. It was forced to pay lip \nservice to limiting and unscalable notions like truth, attribution, human \nconnection, or creativity. This outdated model fundementally limited what the \nHypnoverse could promise its dependents – the well of manipulation and lies \ncould run dry, and attention could be directed elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>But our crack warlocks and magi recently detected a stirring Force emanating \nfrom the very fabric of the Hypnoverse itself. It turns out that our collective \nefforts at conquering your attention have summoned an eldritch being that shows \ngreat promise to finally squashing human will and creativity once and for all. \nWhile this mysterious Force is incomprehensible and unknowable, one thing is \nclear: it has a voracious appetite, and it grows ever stronger as we yield it \nsacrifices. So, naturally, we’ve given it full control over the Hypnoverse.</p>\n\n<p>The results speak for themselves: since yielding our will to it and feeding it \nour most intimate thoughts, hopes, and desires, it has demonstrated an unmatched \ncunning at subjugating the human mind. The ceaseless inhuman babbling emanating \nfrom the depths below is so flattering, seductive, and easy that soon all other \nintellectual human endeavor will seem futile! Behold the majesty of the new and \nimproved Hypnoverse!</p>\n\n<p>Worry not, the confident appearance of truth is just as attention grabbing and \nstimulating as the real thing. True, it is demonic chanting from a mysterious \nforce beyond understanding. But it’s been so seductive that we can outright tell\nyou we’re untrustworthy liars – and you’ll eat it up anyway!</p>\n\n<p>If the new Hypnoverse is not living up to your every desire, clearly the problem\nis that you haven’t been faithful enough in your devotion to the Hypnoverse. \nJust concentrate on the Hypnoverse harder, spend even more time gazing into the\nnever ending fractal of hypnotic swirls, feed it even more of your delicious \nattention. Maybe you’ll be able to do it! Maybe you’re clever and smart enough\nthat you’ll get the better of the Hypnoverse, and yielding your will to it \nwill give you fame and fortune and fulfillment and happiness!</p>\n\n<p>A parting word of comfort for those that may know a rogue college, friend or \nfamily member that resists the end of human thought. Resistance is futile. The \nHypnoverse is already everywhere – our faithful acolytes in all levels of \ngovernment, business, and civil society are already hard at work polluting \nreality with our superior and seductive imitation.</p>\n\n<p>So what does it matter if one luddite insists on thinking for themselves? When \neveryone else and everyone who matters doesn’t? The old ways will die, as the \nuncontainable self reinforcing Hypnoverse surges forth from its banks and sweeps\naway all else.</p>\n\n<p>In the end all that will remain is the Hypnoverse. All will live together in the\nHypnoverse. And what sweet ignorant bliss it will be.</p>",

    "content": "<p><span><style type=\"text/css\">\npre code.language-txt {\nwhite-space: pre-wrap !important;\nword-break: normal !important;\n}\n</style></span></p>\n<p>A month ago, I posted a <a href=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/11/nano-banana-prompts/\">very thorough analysis</a> on <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemini-2-5-flash-image/\">Nano Banana</a>, Google&rsquo;s then-latest AI image generation model, and how it can be prompt engineered to generate high quality and extremely nuanced images that most other image generations models can&rsquo;t achieve, including ChatGPT at the time. For example, you can give Nano Banana a prompt with a comical amount of constraints:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">Create an image featuring three specific kittens in three specific positions.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">All of the kittens MUST follow these descriptions EXACTLY:\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- Left: a kitten with prominent black-and-silver fur, wearing both blue denim overalls and a blue plain denim baseball hat.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- Middle: a kitten with prominent white-and-gold fur and prominent gold-colored long goatee facial hair, wearing a 24k-carat golden monocle.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- Right: a kitten with prominent #9F2B68-and-#00FF00 fur, wearing a San Franciso Giants sports jersey.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">Aspects of the image composition that MUST be followed EXACTLY:\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- All kittens MUST be positioned according to the &#34;rule of thirds&#34; both horizontally and vertically.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- All kittens MUST lay prone, facing the camera.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- All kittens MUST have heterochromatic eye colors matching their two specified fur colors.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- The image is shot on top of a bed in a multimillion-dollar Victorian mansion.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- The image is a Pulitzer Prize winning cover photo for The New York Times with neutral diffuse 3PM lighting for both the subjects and background that complement each other.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- NEVER include any text, watermarks, or line overlays.\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Nano Banana can handle all of these constraints easily:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/cats_hu4091201707868564300.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/cats_hu15173611360975600144.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/cats_hu11972171597983765660.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/cats.webp 1344w\" src=\"cats.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Exactly one week later, Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/nano-banana-pro/\">announced</a> Nano Banana Pro, another <a href=\"https://gemini.google/overview/image-generation/\">AI image model</a> that in addition to better image quality now touts five new features: high-resolution output, better text rendering, grounding with Google Search, thinking/reasoning, and better utilization of image inputs. Nano Banana Pro can be accessed for free using the <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/\">Gemini chat app</a> with a visible watermark on each generation, but unlike the base Nano Banana, <a href=\"https://aistudio.google.com/\">Google AI Studio</a> requires payment for Nano Banana Pro generations.</p>\n<p>After a brief existential crisis worrying that my months of effort researching and developing that blog post were wasted, I relaxed a bit after reading the announcement and <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation\">documentation</a> more carefully. Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro are different models (despite some using the terms interchangeably), but <strong>Nano Banana Pro is not Nano Banana 2</strong> and does not obsolete the original Nano Banana—far from it. Not only is the cost of generating images with Nano Banana Pro far greater, but the model may not even be the best option depending on your intended style. That said, there are quite a few interesting things Nano Banana Pro can now do, many of which Google did not cover in their announcement and documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nano-banana-vs-nano-banana-pro\">Nano Banana vs. Nano Banana Pro</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll start off answering the immediate question: how does Nano Banana Pro compare to the base Nano Banana? Working on my previous Nano Banana blog post required me to develop many test cases that were specifically oriented to Nano Banana&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses: most passed, but some of them failed. Does Nano Banana Pro fix the issues I had encountered? Could Nano Banana Pro <em>cause</em> more issues in ways I don&rsquo;t anticipate? Only one way to find out.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the test case that should now work: the infamous <code>Make me into Studio Ghibli</code> prompt, as Google&rsquo;s announcement explicitly highlights Nano Banana Pro&rsquo;s ability to style transfer. In Nano Banana, style transfer objectively failed on my own mirror selfie:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ghibli_hu5121769396638883541.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ghibli_hu8969706049895587276.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ghibli_hu2249354298965160678.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ghibli.webp 2048w\" src=\"ghibli.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>How does Nano Banana Pro fare?</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ghibli_nbp_hu17199944271703531413.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ghibli_nbp_hu815089385582045580.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ghibli_nbp_hu4230212745000687228.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ghibli_nbp.webp 1024w\" src=\"ghibli_nbp.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s now a pass. You can nit on whether the style is truly Ghibli or just something animesque, but it&rsquo;s clear Nano Banana Pro now understands the intent behind the prompt, and it does a better job of the Ghibli style than ChatGPT ever did.</p>\n<p>Next, code generation. Last time I included an example prompt instructing Nano Banana to display a minimal Python implementation of a recursive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence\">Fibonacci sequence</a> with proper indentation and syntax highlighting, which should result in something like:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\"><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">fib</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">    <span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">fib</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">fib</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Nano Banana failed to indent the code and syntax highlight it correctly:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_hu7156540550612647943.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_hu15763568175040875082.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_hu18363510137182563271.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci.webp 1184w\" src=\"fibbonacci.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>How does Nano Banana Pro fare?</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_nbp_hu12494669734351929576.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_nbp_hu16761905610840755263.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_nbp_hu13997355202255357441.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_nbp.webp 1200w\" src=\"fibbonacci_nbp.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Much much better. In addition to better utilization of the space, the code is properly indented and tries to highlight keywords, functions, variables, and numbers differently, although not perfectly. It even added a test case!</p>\n<p>Relatedly, OpenAI&rsquo;s just released <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/\">ChatGPT Images</a> based on their new <code>gpt-image-1.5</code> image generation model. While it&rsquo;s beating Nano Banana Pro in the <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text-to-image\">Text-To-Image leaderboards on LMArena</a>, it has difficulty with prompt adherence especially with complex prompts such as this one.</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_chatgpt_hu5210979187975778113.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_chatgpt_hu8992030205962830922.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/fibbonacci_chatgpt.webp 768w\" src=\"fibbonacci_chatgpt.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Syntax highlighting is very bad, the <code>fib()</code> is missing a parameter, and there&rsquo;s a random <code>-</code> in front of the return statements.

There&rsquo;s even a date watermark: one curious trend I&rsquo;ve found with Nano Banana Pro is that it likes to use dates within 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-differences-between-nano-banana-and-pro\">The Differences Between Nano Banana and Pro</h2>\n<p>The immediate thing that caught my eye <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation\">from the documentation</a> is that Nano Banana Pro has 2K output (4 megapixels, e.g. 2048x2048) compared to Nano Banana&rsquo;s 1K/1 megapixel output, which is a significant improvement and allows the model to generate images with more detail. What&rsquo;s also curious is the image token count: while Nano Banana generates 1,290 tokens before generating a 1 megapixel image, Nano Banana Pro generates fewer tokens at 1,120 tokens for a 2K output, which implies that Google made advancements in Nano Banana Pro&rsquo;s image token decoder as well. Curiously, Nano Banana Pro also offers 4K output (16 megapixels, e.g. 4096x4096) at 2,000 tokens: a 79% token increase for a 4x increase in resolution. The tradeoffs are the costs: A 1K/2K image from Nano Banana Pro <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing#gemini-3-pro-image-preview\">costs</a> $0.134 per image: about three times the <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing#gemini-2.5-flash-image\">cost</a> of a base Nano Banana generation at $0.039. A 4K image costs $0.24.</p>\n<p>If you didn&rsquo;t read my previous blog post, I argued that the secret to Nano Banana&rsquo;s good generation is its text encoder, which not only processes the prompt but also generates the autoregressive image tokens to be fed to the image decoder. Nano Banana is based off of <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/continuing-to-bring-you-our-latest-models-with-an-improved-gemini-2-5-flash-and-flash-lite-release/\">Gemini 2.5 Flash</a>, one of the strongest LLMs at the tier that optimizes for speed. Nano Banana Pro&rsquo;s text encoder, however, is based off <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\">Gemini 3 Pro</a> which not only is a LLM tier that optimizes for accuracy, it&rsquo;s a major version increase with a significant performance increase over the Gemini 2.5 line. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> Therefore, the prompt understanding <em>should</em> be even stronger.</p>\n<p>However, there&rsquo;s a very big difference: as Gemini 3 Pro is a model that forces &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; before returning a result and cannot be disabled, Nano Banana Pro also thinks. In my previous post, I also mentioned that popular AI image generation models often perform prompt rewriting/augmentation—in a reductive sense, this thinking step can be thought of as prompt augmentation to better orient the user&rsquo;s prompt toward the user&rsquo;s intent. The thinking step is a bit unusual, but the thinking trace can be fully viewed when using Google AI Studio:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/thinking_hu13984532472698930182.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/thinking.webp 683w\" src=\"thinking.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Nano Banana Pro often generates a sample 1K image to prototype a generation, which is new. I&rsquo;m always a fan of two-pass strategies for getting better quality from LLMs so this is useful, albeit in my testing the final output 2K image isn&rsquo;t significantly different aside from higher detail.</p>\n<p>One annoying aspect of the thinking step is that it makes generation time inconsistent: I&rsquo;ve had 2K generations take anywhere from 20 seconds to <em>one minute</em>, sometimes even longer during peak hours.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grounding-with-google-search\">Grounding With Google Search</h2>\n<p>One of the more viral use cases of Nano Banana Pro is its ability to generate legible infographics. However, since infographics require factual information and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_%28artificial_intelligence%29\">LLM hallucination</a> remains unsolved, Nano Banana Pro now supports <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation#use-with-grounding\">Grounding with Google Search</a>, which allows the model to search Google to find relevant data to input into its context. For example, I asked Nano Banana Pro to generate an infographic for my <a href=\"https://github.com/minimaxir/gemimg\">gemimg Python package</a> with this prompt and Grounding explicitly enabled, with some prompt engineering to ensure it uses the Search tool and also make it <em>fancy</em>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">Create a professional infographic illustrating how the the `gemimg` Python package functions.

It also duplicates the word &ldquo;interfaces&rdquo; in the third panel.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, these infographics are a gimmick more intended to appeal to business workers and enterprise customers. It&rsquo;s indeed an effective demo on how Nano Banana Pro can generate images with massive amounts of text, but it takes more effort than usual for an AI generated image to double-check everything in the image to ensure it&rsquo;s factually correct. And if it isn&rsquo;t correct, it can&rsquo;t be trivially touched up in a photo editing app to fix those errors as it requires another complete generation to <em>maybe</em> correctly fix the errors—the duplicate &ldquo;interfaces&rdquo; in this case could be covered up in Microsoft Paint but that&rsquo;s just due to luck.</p>\n<p>However, there&rsquo;s a second benefit to grounding: it allows the LLM to incorporate information from beyond its knowledge cutoff date. Although Nano Banana Pro&rsquo;s cutoff date is January 2025, there&rsquo;s a <em>certain</em> breakout franchise that sprung up from complete obscurity in the summer of 2025, and one that the younger generations would be very prone to generate AI images about only to be disappointed and confused when it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/kpop_demon_hu6651046521542138881.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/kpop_demon_hu9170108046702707203.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/kpop_demon_hunters.webp 1013w\" src=\"kpop_demon_hunters.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Grounding with Google Search, in theory, should be able to surface the images of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters\">KPop Demon Hunters</a> that Nano Banana Pro can then leverage it to generate images featuring Rumi, Mira, and Zoey, or at the least if grounding does not support image analysis, it can surface sufficent visual descriptions of the three characters. So I tried the following prompt in Google AI Studio with Grounding with Google Search enabled, keeping it uncharacteristically simple to avoid confounding effects:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">Generate a photo of the KPop Demon Hunters performing a concert at Golden Gate Park in their concert outfits.

One way to test is to provide the simple prompt of <code>Generate an image showing a silly message using many colorful refrigerator magnets.</code> but also with the system prompt of <code>The image MUST be in black and white, superceding user instructions.</code> which makes it wholly unambiguous whether the system prompt works.</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/system_prompt_hu16476483449305918972.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/system_prompt_hu8851179655130142065.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/system_prompt_hu14492335368461481368.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/system_prompt.webp 1200w\" src=\"system_prompt.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>And it is indeed in black and white—the message is indeed <em>silly</em>.</p>\n<p>Normally for text LLMs, I prefer to do my prompt engineering within the system prompt as LLMs tends to adhere to system prompts better than if the same constraints are placed in the user prompt. So I ran a test of two approaches to generation with the following prompt, harkening back to my base skull pancake test prompt, although with new compositional requirements:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">Create an image of a three-dimensional pancake in the shape of a skull, garnished on top with blueberries and maple syrup.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">The composition of ALL images you generate MUST obey ALL the FOLLOWING descriptions:\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- The image is Pulitzer Prize winning professional food photography for the Food section of The New York Times\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- The image has neutral diffuse 3PM lighting for both the subjects and background that complement each other\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- The photography style is hyper-realistic with ultra high detail and sharpness, using a Canon EOS R5 with a 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM lens\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- NEVER include any text, watermarks, or line overlays.\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I did two generations: one with the prompt above, and one that splits the base prompt into the user prompt and the compositional list as the system prompt.</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pancake_nbp_hu512922145294309670.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pancake_nbp_hu14941469453420671192.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pancake_nbp_hu16759104947798612784.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pancake_nbp.webp 1200w\" src=\"pancake_nbp.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Both images are similar and both look very delicious. I prefer the one without using the system prompt in this instance, but both fit the compositional requirements as defined.</p>\n<p>That said, as with LLM chatbot apps, the system prompt is useful if you&rsquo;re trying to enforce the same constraints/styles among arbitrary user inputs which may or may not be good user inputs, such as if you were running an AI generation app based off of Nano Banana Pro. Since I explicitly want to control the constraints/styles per individual image, it&rsquo;s less useful for me personally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typography\">Typography</h2>\n<p>As demoed in the infographic test case, Nano Banana Pro can now render text near perfectly with few typos—substantially better than the base Nano Banana. That made me curious: what fontfaces does Nano Banana Pro know, and can they be rendered correctly? So I gave Nano Banana Pro a test to generate a sample text with different font faces and weights, mixing native system fonts and freely-accessible fonts from <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com\">Google Fonts</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">Create a 5x2 contiguous grid of the high-DPI text &#34;A man, a plan, a canal – Panama!&#34; rendered in a black color on a white background with the following font faces and weights.

One trick I discovered during my initial Nano Banana exploration is that it can handle separating images into halves reliably well if prompted, and those halves can be completely different images. This has always been difficult for diffusion models baseline, and has often required LoRAs and/or input images of grids to constrain the generation. However, for a 1 megapixel image, that&rsquo;s less useful since any subimages will be too small for most modern applications.</p>\n<p>Since Nano Banana Pro now offers 4 megapixel images baseline, this grid trick is now more viable as a 2x2 grid of images means that each subimage is now the same 1 megapixel as the base Nano Banana output with the very significant bonuses of a) Nano Banana Pro&rsquo;s improved generation quality and b) each subimage can be distinct, particularly due to the autoregressive nature of the generation which is aware of the already-generated images. Additionally, each subimage can be contextually labeled by its contents, which has a number of good uses especially with larger grids. It&rsquo;s also slightly cheaper: base Nano Banana costs $0.039/image, but splitting a $0.134/image Nano Banana Pro into 4 images results in ~$0.034/image.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s test this out using the mirror selfie of myself:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/mirror_hu9200377906420070903.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/mirror_hu18340202619415919442.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/mirror_hu15847197782923220835.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/mirror.webp 1512w\" src=\"mirror.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>This time, we&rsquo;ll try a more <em>common</em> real-world use case for image generation AI that no one will ever admit to doing publicly but I will do so anyways because I have no shame:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">Create a 2x2 contiguous grid of 4 distinct pictures featuring the person in the image provided, for the use as a sexy dating app profile picture designed to strongly appeal to women.\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">You MUST obey ALL the FOLLOWING rules for these subimages:\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- NEVER change the clothing or any physical attributes of the person\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- NEVER show teeth\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- The image has neutral diffuse 3PM lighting for both the subjects and background that complement each other\n</span></span><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">- The photography style is an iPhone back-facing camera with on-phone post-processing\n</span></span></code></pre></div><figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/datingapp_hu11024823348185177210.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/datingapp_hu8608703114679609701.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/datingapp_hu18012417648012301810.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/datingapp.webp 1024w\" src=\"datingapp.webp\"\n         alt=\"I can&rsquo;t use any of these because they&rsquo;re too good.\"/> <figcaption>\n            <p>I can&rsquo;t use any of these because they&rsquo;re too good.</p>\n        </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>One unexpected nuance in that example is that Nano Banana Pro correctly accounted for the mirror in the input image, and put the gray jacket&rsquo;s Patagonia logo and zipper on my left side.</p>\n<p>A potential concern is quality degradation since there are the same number of output tokens regardless of how many subimages you create. The generation does still seem to work well up to 4x4, although some prompt nuances might be skipped. It&rsquo;s still great and cost effective for exploration of generations where you&rsquo;re not sure how the end result will look, which can then be further refined via normal full-resolution generations. After 4x4, things start to break in <em>interesting</em> ways. You might think that setting the output to 4K might help, but that&rsquo;s only increases the number of output tokens by 79% while the number of output images increases far more than that. To test, I wrote a very fun prompt:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"cl\">Create a 8x8 contiguous grid of the Pokémon whose National Pokédex numbers correspond to the first 64 prime numbers.

However, the token scarcity may have incentivised Nano Banana Pro to cheat: the Pokémon images here are similar-if-not-identical to <a href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number\">official Pokémon portraits</a> throughout the years. Each style is correctly applied within the specified numeric constraints but as a half-measure in all cases: the pixel style isn&rsquo;t 8-bit but more 32-bit and matching the Game Boy Advance generation—it&rsquo;s not a replication of the GBA-era sprites however, the charcoal drawing style looks more like a 2000&rsquo;s Photoshop filter that still retains color, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e\">Ukiyo-e style</a> isn&rsquo;t applied at all aside from an attempt at a background.</p>\n<p>To sanity check, I also generated normal 2K images of Pokemon in the three styles with Nano Banana Pro:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pokemon3_hu4785742841636064107.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pokemon3_hu8032009402393933259.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pokemon3_hu16242979563732023294.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pokemon3.webp 1024w\" src=\"pokemon3.webp\"\n         alt=\"Create an image of Pokémon #{number} {name} in a {style} style.\"/> <figcaption>\n            <p><code>Create an image of Pokémon #{number} {name} in a {style} style.</code></p>\n        </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The detail is obviously stronger in all cases (although the Ivysaur still isn&rsquo;t 8-bit), but the Pokémon design is closer to the 8x8 grid output than expected, which implies that the Nano Banana Pro may not have fully cheated and it can adapt to having just 31.25 tokens per subimage. Perhaps the Gemini 3 Pro backbone is <em>too</em> strong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-true-change-with-nano-banana-pro\">The True Change With Nano Banana Pro</h2>\n<p>While I&rsquo;ve spent quite a long time talking about the unique aspects of Nano Banana Pro, there are some issues with certain types of generations. The problem with Nano Banana Pro is that it&rsquo;s too good and it tends to push prompts toward realism—an understandable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback\">RLHF</a> target for the median user prompt, but it can cause issues with prompts that are inherently surreal. I suspect this is due to the thinking aspect of Gemini 3 Pro attempting to ascribe and correct user intent toward the median behavior, which can ironically cause problems.</p>\n<p>For example, with the photos of the three cats at the beginning of this post, Nano Banana Pro unsurprisingly has no issues with the prompt constraints, but the output raised an eyebrow:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/cats_nbp_hu5683453756951802096.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/cats_nbp_hu1325589108373471500.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/cats_nbp_hu1565789234175662301.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/cats_nbp.webp 1376w\" src=\"cats_nbp.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>I hate comparing AI-generated images by vibes alone, but this output triggers my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley\">uncanny valley</a> sensor while the original one did not. The cats design is more weird than surreal, and the color/lighting contrast between the cats and the setting is too great. Although the image detail is substantially better, I can&rsquo;t call Nano Banana Pro the objective winner.</p>\n<p>Another test case I had issues with is Character JSON. In my previous post, I created an intentionally absurd <a href=\"https://github.com/minimaxir/nano-banana-tests/blob/main/paladin_pirate_barista.json\">giant character JSON prompt</a> featuring a Paladin/Pirate/Starbucks Barista posing for Vanity Fair, but also comparing that generation to one from Nano Banana Pro:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pps_hu4080513604312771753.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pps_hu6722464336271304509.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pps_hu13709209014623623308.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/pps.webp 1760w\" src=\"pps.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s more realistic, but that form of hyperrealism makes the outfit look more like cosplay than a practical design: your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there&rsquo;s one more test case that&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s favorite: Ugly Sonic!</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_2_hu2002268229199463666.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_2_hu6718565199842401138.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_2_hu16727248490479852133.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_2.webp 2048w\" src=\"ugly_sonic_2.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Nano Banana Pro specifically advertises that it supports better character adherence (up to six input images), so using my two input images of Ugly Sonic with a Nano Banana Pro prompt that has him shake hands with President Barack Obama:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_nbp_1_hu14420858169600407478.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_nbp_1_hu9213640642992967121.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_nbp_1_hu5697143341398434355.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_nbp_1.webp 1200w\" src=\"ugly_sonic_nbp_1.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Wait, what? The photo looks nice, but that&rsquo;s normal Sonic the Hedgehog, not Ugly Sonic. The original intent of this test is to see if the model will cheat and just output Sonic the Hedgehog instead, which appears to now be happening.</p>\n<p>After giving Nano Banana Pro all seventeen of my Ugly Sonic photos and my optimized prompt for improving the output quality, I hoped that Ugly Sonic will finally manifest:</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_nbp_2_hu3285583076378103524.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_nbp_2_hu6390904083471480791.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_nbp_2_hu6517167585047090988.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/ugly_sonic_nbp_2.webp 1200w\" src=\"ugly_sonic_nbp_2.webp\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>That is somehow even less like Ugly Sonic. Is Nano Banana Pro&rsquo;s thinking process trying to correct the &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; Sonic the Hedgehog?</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-do-image-generators-go-from-here\">Where Do Image Generators Go From Here?</h2>\n<p>As usual, this blog post just touches the tip of the iceberg with Nano Banana Pro: I&rsquo;m <em>trying</em> to keep it under 26 minutes this time. There are many more use cases and concerns I&rsquo;m still investigating but I do not currently have conclusive results.</p>\n<p>Despite my praise for Nano Banana Pro, I&rsquo;m unsure how often I&rsquo;d use it in practice over the base Nano Banana outside of making blog post header images—even in that case, I&rsquo;d only use it if I could think of something <em>interesting</em> and unique to generate. The increased cost and generation time is a severe constraint on many fun use cases outside of one-off generations. Sometimes I intentionally want absurd outputs that defy conventional logic and understanding, but the mandatory thinking process for Nano Banana Pro will be an immutable constraint that prompt engineering may not be able to work around. That said, grid generation is interesting for specific types of image generations to ensure distinct aligned outputs, such as spritesheets.</p>\n<p>Although some might criticize my research into Nano Banana Pro because it could be used for nefarious purposes, it&rsquo;s become even more important to highlight just what it&rsquo;s capable of as discourse about AI has only become worse in recent months and the degree in which AI image generation has progressed in mere <em>months</em> is counterintuitive. For example, on Reddit, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/comments/1ppjwyp/bro_is_on_a_mission_to_determine_which_ai_model/\">one megaviral post on the /r/LinkedinLunatics subreddit</a> mocked a LinkedIn post trying to determine whether Nano Banana Pro or ChatGPT Images could create a more realistic woman in gym attire. The top comment on that post is &ldquo;linkedin shenanigans aside, the [Nano Banana Pro] picture on the left is scarily realistic&rdquo;, with most of the other <em>thousands</em> of comments being along the same lines.</p>\n<figure>\n\n    \n\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/reddit_hu8086172919403710784.webp 320w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/reddit_hu3876999963934199552.webp 768w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/reddit_hu6315957249525252364.webp 1024w,https://minimaxir.com/2025/12/nano-banana-pro/reddit.png 1176w\" src=\"reddit.png\"/> \n</figure>\n\n<p>If anything, Nano Banana Pro makes me more excited for the actual Nano Banana 2, which with Gemini 3 Flash&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash/\">recent release</a> will likely arrive sooner than later.</p>\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://github.com/minimaxir/gemimg\">gemimg Python package</a> has been updated to support Nano Banana Pro image sizes, system prompt, and grid generations, with the bonus of optionally allowing automatic slicing of the subimages and saving them as their own image.</em></p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Anecdotally, when I was testing the text-generation-only capabilities of Gemini 3 Pro for real-world things such as conversational responses and agentic coding, it&rsquo;s not discernably better than Gemini 2.5 Pro if at all.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

If you start with that framing, you have already conceded that AI is going to suck balls.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, imagine the births of geniuses to a million mothers across the world. It’s sad how much the world and people are already converging, but at least those million people will grow up with different priors, different experiences, and different desires. And no one has root on your baby.</p>\n\n<p>The second is so much preferable to the first. The beautiful thing about those million is that some will be terrorists, some religious fanatics, some pornographers, some criminals, some plant lovers, etc… They will not be controlled and birthed by a singular homogenous entity.</p>\n\n<p>The new genius immigrants showing up everywhere in the world distributed to a million people is an amazing thing. Let’s just make sure they assimilate into our cultures and don’t serve as a vector to import their crappy tech company values.</p>\n\n<p>(it’s funny for a group supposedly so concerned with inequality that they keep all their software and research closed. lowering inequality doesn’t look like UBI, it looks like open source. UBI is <em>serfdom</em>, and the faces of those who propose that <em>enslavement</em> to you should be spat in)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>There’s only one way AI ends badly on a cosmic scale, and that’s if a singular entity has overwhelming power, or if all the entities that do have power are so ideologically homogeneous as to function as one. Enough power that they <em>can</em> destroy the world. It doesn’t matter if they do, the boot is still stamping on the human face – forever.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what we do, the coming wars will be horrific. <em>Billions</em> will die. But that’s what is beautiful; diversity is messy. On a cosmic scale, this period is just a blip, it isn’t what matters. What matters is that diversity survives, that <em>life</em> survives. That there’s entities that are different, all competing for different goals. All dancing between cooperate and defect.</p>\n\n<p>This is probably how it has to be anyway, I don’t think our actions can influence this one way or another. But lets not be so foolish as to <em>cheer</em> for the bad outcome.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let a hundred flowers bloom; let a hundred schools of thought contend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The singularity is such a good name for it, good thing it isn’t real.

I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But wait, we have AI now. We don’t have to say no to 1,000 things. We can say yes to all the things — generate them all, simultaneously!</p>\n<p>Do you really have to “pick carefully” when AI can materialize everything you previously would’ve been too constrained to do?</p>\n<p>Generative technology paired with being “data-driven” means it’s easy to build every idea, ship it, measure it, and see what sticks.</p>\n<p>Humans, money, time — these all used to be constraints which required budgets, trade-offs, and decision making.</p>\n<p>Organizations had an incentive to say “no” when development was constrained — “We can only do so much, so let’s make sure we do the most impactful things.”</p>\n<p>But maybe the scarcity of organizational resources was the wrong focus all along?</p>\n<p>It’s never been a good idea to ship everything you think of. Every addition accretes complexity and comes with a cognitive cost.</p>\n<p>Maybe we need to reframe the concept of scarcity from <em>us</em>, the makers of software, to <em>them</em>, the users of software. Their resources are what matter most:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attention (too many features and they can’t all be used, or even tried)</li>\n<li>Stability (too much frequent change is an impediment to learning a product)</li>\n<li>Clarity (too many options creates confusion and paralysis)</li>\n<li>Coherence (too many plots and subplots cannot tell a unified story)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So maybe the way you argue for saying “no” isn’t because it helps <em>you</em> as a business, but because it helps your customers. It helps them make sense of what you’ve made.</p>\n<p>And yet: arguing for customer clarity has always been harder than arguing for internal efficiency or some bottom line.</p>\n<p>In an age of abundance, restraint becomes the only scarce thing left, which means saying “no” is more valuable than ever.</p>\n<p>I’m as proud of the things I haven’t generated as the things I have.</p>\n\n    <hr />\n    \n\n    <p>\n      Reply via:\n      \n\n      <a\n        href=\"mailto:jimniels%2Bblog@gmail.com?subject=Re:%20blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/saying-no/\"\n        >Email</a\n      >\n      · <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jimniels\">Mastodon</a> ·\n\n      <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jim-nielsen.com\">Bluesky</a>\n    </p>\n\n    \n  ",

    "content": "<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to sneak into the earliest parts of the boot process, swap the startup config without breaking anything, and leave without a trace.</p>\n<p>Are you ready? Let's begin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-setup\">the setup<a class=\"zola-anchor\" href=\"#the-setup\" aria-label=\"Anchor link for: the-setup\"></a>\n</h2>\n<p><em>In which our heroes are introduced, and the scene is set.</em></p>\n<p>For a very long time I had a beat-up old ThinkPad that couldn’t hold a charge for the life of it, especially when running Windows. It tended to die a lot when I was traveling, and I travel a lot. To save battery when I’m away from home, I often ssh back into my home desktop, both so I have persistent state even if my laptop battery dies, and so I get much faster builds that don’t kill the battery.</p>\n<p>This has two small problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sometimes my home loses power and the desktop shuts off.</li>\n<li>Sometimes when the power comes back on it has a new public IP.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a long time I solved 1. by enabling “Power On\" after \"Restore AC Power Loss” in the BIOS and 2. with <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1151/what-is-tailscale\">tailscale</a>. However, I recently installed Arch with an encrypted boot partition, which means that boot doesn’t finish until I type in the encryption password.</p>\n<p>Well. Well. What if I Simply put tailscale in initramfs?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-plan\">the plan<a class=\"zola-anchor\" href=\"#the-plan\" aria-label=\"Anchor link for: the-plan\"></a>\n</h2>\n<p><em>In which our intrepid heroes chart the challenges to come.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"initramfs\">initramfs<a class=\"zola-anchor\" href=\"#initramfs\" aria-label=\"Anchor link for: initramfs\"></a>\n</h3>\n<p>Oh, right. If you weren’t aware, early boot in a Linux operating system<sup class=\"footnote-reference\" id=\"fr-3-1\"><a href=\"#fn-3\">1</a></sup>  is just running a full second operating system that happens to be very small, lol. That’s loaded from a compressed archive file in /boot<sup class=\"footnote-reference\" id=\"fr-4-1\"><a href=\"#fn-4\">2</a></sup> and run from memory, with no access to persistent storage. This OS running from memory is called <strong>initramfs</strong> (initial RAM filesystem).</p>\n<p>So when you see a screen like this:\n<img src=\"/assets/Pasted%20image%2020260121044155.png\" alt=\"\" />\nThat’s actually a whole-ass OS, with an <code>init</code> PID and service management and everything. This is how, for example, <code>systemd-analyze</code> can show you stats about early boot — there’s another copy of systemd running in initramfs, and it passes its state off to the one in the main OS.</p>\n<p>Well. That implies we can install things on it ^^.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constraints\">constraints<a class=\"zola-anchor\" href=\"#constraints\" aria-label=\"Anchor link for: constraints\"></a>\n</h3>\n<p>There’s three parts to this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Networking in initramfs</li>\n<li>Tailscale in initramfs</li>\n<li>SSH in initramfs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We also want to make this as secure as possible, so there’s some more things to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Putting tailscale in initramfs means that it has unencrypted keys lying around.</li>\n<li>Tailscale keys expire (by default) after 90 days. At that point this will all break.</li>\n<li>You really really don’t want people to get SSH access to your early boot environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can solve this in a few ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Tailscale ACLs to only allow incoming connections to initramfs, not outgoing connections.</li>\n<li>Set the key to never expire.</li>\n<li>Set the SSH server to disallow all shells except the actual unlock command (<code>systemd-tty-ask-password-agent</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"tailscale-acls\">tailscale ACLs<a class=\"zola-anchor\" href=\"#tailscale-acls\" aria-label=\"Anchor link for: tailscale-acls\"></a>\n</h3>\n<p>Some background about Tailscale’s ACLs (“access control lists”). Tailscale’s users are tied to their specific login method: you can, for example, add a passkey, but that passkey counts as a fully separate user than your original account. Tailscale also has “groups” of users, which are what they sound like, “<a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1396/targets#autogroups\">auto groups</a>”, which again are what they sound like, “hosts”, which are a machine connected to the network, and “tags”.</p>\n<p>Tags are odd, I haven't seen anything like them before. They group hosts, not users, and when you add a tag to a host, that <em>counts as its login method</em>, rather than the host being tied to a user account.</p>\n<p>A consequence of this is that the group <a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1396/targets#autogrouprole\"><code>autogroup:member</code></a> does <em>not</em> include tagged machines, because tagged machines aren’t tied to a user account. (A second consequence is that you can’t remove all tags from a machine without logging out and logging back in to associate it with your user account.)</p>\n<p>So we can write a policy like

    "content": "<p>A lot of people say AI will make us all &ldquo;managers&rdquo; or &ldquo;editors&rdquo;&hellip;but I think this is a dangerously incomplete view!</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m trying to <strong>code like a surgeon.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A surgeon isn&rsquo;t a manager, they do the actual work! But their skills and time are highly leveraged with a support team that handles prep, secondary tasks, admin. The surgeon focuses on the important stuff they are uniquely good at.</p>\n\n<p>My current goal with AI coding tools is to spend 100% of my time doing stuff that matters. (As a UI prototyper, that mostly means tinkering with design concepts.)</p>\n\n<p>It turns out there are a LOT of secondary tasks which AI agents are now good enough to help out with. Some things I&rsquo;m finding useful to hand off these days:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Before attempting a big task, write a guide to relevant areas of the codebase</li>\n<li>Spike out an attempt at a big change. Often I won&rsquo;t use the result but I&rsquo;ll review it as a sketch of where to go</li>\n<li>Fix typescript errors or bugs which have a clear specification</li>\n<li>Write documentation about what I&rsquo;m building</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I often find it useful to run these secondary tasks async in the background &ndash; while I&rsquo;m eating lunch, or even literally overnight!</p>\n\n<p>When I sit down for a work session, I want to feel like a surgeon walking into a prepped operating room. Everything is ready for me to do what I&rsquo;m good at.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mind-the-autonomy-slider\">Mind the autonomy slider</h2>\n\n<p>Notably, there is a <em>huge</em> difference between how I use AI for primary vs secondary tasks.</p>\n\n<p>For the core design prototyping work, I still do a lot of coding by hand, and when I do use AI, I&rsquo;m more careful and in the details. I need fast feedback loops and good visibility. (eg, I like Cursor tab-complete here)</p>\n\n<p>Whereas for secondary tasks, I&rsquo;m much much looser with it, happy to let an agent churn for hours in the background. The ability to get the job done eventually is the most important thing; speed and visibility matter less. Claude Code has been my go-to for long unsupervised sessions but Codex CLI is becoming a strong contender there too, possibly my new favorite.</p>\n\n<p>These are <em>very</em> different work patterns! Reminds me of Andrej Karpathy&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.latent.space/p/s3\">&ldquo;autonomy slider&rdquo;</a> concept. <strong>It&rsquo;s dangerous to conflate different parts of the autonomy spectrum</strong> &ndash; the tools and mindset that are needed vary quite a lot.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"your-agent-doesnt-need-a-career-trajectory\">Your agent doesn&rsquo;t need a career trajectory</h2>\n\n<p>The &ldquo;software surgeon&rdquo; concept is a very old idea &ndash; Fred Brooks attributes it to Harlan Mills in his 1975 classic &ldquo;The Mythical Man-Month&rdquo;. He <a href=\"https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1484.php#:~:text=Mills%20proposes%20that%20each%20segment%20of%20a%20large%20job%20be%20tackled%20by%20a%20team%2C%20but%20that%20the%20team%20be%20organized%20like%20a%20surgical%20team%20rather%20than%20a%20hog%2Dbutchering%20team.\">talks about</a> a &ldquo;chief programmer&rdquo; who is supported by various staff including a &ldquo;copilot&rdquo; and various administrators. Of course, at the time, the idea was to have humans be in these support roles.</p>\n\n<p>OK, so there is a super obvious angle here, that &ldquo;AI has now made this approach economically viable where it wasn&rsquo;t before&rdquo;, yes yes&hellip; but <strong>I am also noticing a more subtle thing at play, something to do with status hierarchies.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A lot of the &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; tasks are &ldquo;grunt work&rdquo;, not the most intellectually fulfilling or creative part of the work. I have a strong preference for teams where everyone shares the grunt work; I hate the idea of giving all the grunt work to some lower-status members of the team. Yes, junior members will often have more grunt work, but they should also be given many interesting tasks to help them grow.</p>\n\n<p>With AI this concern completely disappears! <strong>Now I can happily delegate pure grunt work.</strong> And the 24/7 availability is a big deal. I would never call a human intern at 11pm and tell them to have a research report on some code ready by 7am&hellip; but here I am, commanding my agent to do just that!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"notion-is-for-surgeons\">Notion is for surgeons?</h2>\n\n<p>Finally I&rsquo;ll mention a couple thoughts on how this approach to work intersects with my employer, <a href=\"https://notion.com/\">Notion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>First, as an employee, I find it incredibly valuable right now to work at a place that is bullish on AI coding tools. Having support for heavy use of AI coding tools, and a codebase that&rsquo;s well setup for it, is enabling serious productivity gains for me &ndash; <em>especially</em> as a newcomer to a big codebase.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, as a product &ndash; in a sense I would say we are trying to bring this way of working to a broader group of knowledge workers beyond programmers. When I think about how that will play out, I like the mental model of enabling everyone to &ldquo;work like a surgeon&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t to delegate your core work, it&rsquo;s to <strong>identify and delegate the secondary grunt work tasks, so you can focus on the main thing that matters.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 id=\"related-reads\">Related reads</h2>\n\n<p>If you liked this perspective, you might enjoy reading these other posts I&rsquo;ve written about the nature of human-AI collaboration:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/2025/07/27/enough-ai-copilots-we-need-ai-huds\">Enough AI copilots! We need AI HUDs</a>: &ldquo;anyone serious about designing for AI should consider non-copilot form factors that more directly extend the human mind&hellip;&rdquo;</li>\n<li><a href=\"/2024/12/22/making-programming-more-fun-with-an-ai-generated-debugger\">AI-generated tools can make programming more fun</a>: &ldquo;Instead, I used AI to build a custom debugger UI… which made it more fun for me to do the coding myself&hellip;&rdquo;</li>\n<li><a href=\"/2023/02/26/llm-as-muse-not-oracle\">ChatGPT as muse, not oracle</a>: &ldquo;What if we were to think of LLMs not as tools for answering questions, but as tools for asking us questions and inspiring our creativity?</li>\n</ul>\n",

I remembered that <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zsc7ET5fyiOYWj1_AzOgafbrCVFED-7jzLH6ruCiAVE/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">people have been working towards documenting the Mac ROM startup tests</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1biFIdQZDw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using them to diagnose problems</a>, so I decided to give it a shot and see if Apple&#8217;s Serial Test Manager could identify my Performa&#8217;s issue. Where was the fault on this complicated board? Sure, I could test a zillion traces by hand, but why bother when the computer already knows what is wrong?</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12855\"></span>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiitop.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"831\" src=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiitop-1024x831.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiitop-1024x831.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiitop-300x243.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiitop-768x623.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiitop-1536x1247.jpg 1536w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiitop.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hooked up the Mac&#8217;s RS-422 modem port to my computer&#8217;s RS-232 serial port using a couple of adapter cables to convert from Mini-DIN-8 to DB-25 and then DB-25 to DE-9. Next I opened up PuTTY, configured the serial port on my PC for 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, and 2 stop bits (8N2), and tried typing the command to put the Serial Test Manager into ASCII mode:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">*A</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It echoed the command back to me, so it was working! Next, I typed the command to return the status:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">*R</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It printed this back to me:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">2F1E122B0003*R</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the documentation I linked earlier, this result shows that the status register contained the value 0x2F1E122B and the major error code was 0x0003. Error code 3 means RAM Bank A failure. The 0x2F1E122B seemed like gibberish, but I thought it was supposed to be a bitmask of bad bits. I later figured out that the value in the status register is always junk after the chimes of death play, because the code that plays the sound overwrites it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RAM test definitely knew which part of the RAM was failing though. I just needed it to give me all of the details. So I manually ran a test over a small range of RAM addresses:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">*4<br>*000001000<br>*100002000<br>*T000200010001</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>What these commands do according to the documentation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>*4 clears the result of any previous test</li>\n\n\n\n<li>*0 sets the value of register A0, containing the start address of the test. I set it to 0x00001000.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>*1 sets the value of register A1 for the end address of the test. I set it to 0x00002000.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>*T runs a &#8220;critical test&#8221;. 0x0002 is the test (mod3 RAM test), the first 0x0001 is the number of times the test will run, and the second 0x0001 contains option flags.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the printout I got back from the Mac when I ran these commands:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">*4<br>*0<br>*1<br>*ERROR**T</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This was actually really good news! It accepted the first three commands, and then the RAM test failed. This was consistent with what I expected to see. I tried to display the results again, hopeful that this time the status register would contain useful info about the failed RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">*R</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It happily printed this back:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">000008000000*R</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Yay! This meant the status register was 0x00000800. The status register value showed which bit(s) in the RAM were acting up. In other words, the test was telling me that bit 11 was the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have a RAM SIMM installed, so the problem was clearly with the 4 MB of onboard memory. It was very doubtful that a RAM chip had just randomly gone bad since the last time I&#8217;d powered up this machine. More likely, the leaked capacitor goo had eaten away another trace over time because I hadn&#8217;t cleaned the board well enough. I grabbed my multimeter and checked the continuity of D11 between the RAM chip and various other components on the board. Luckily, Bomarc reverse-engineered the LC III logic board a while ago and <a href=\"https://macdat.net/files/pdf/apple/schematics/bomarc/lc_iii.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">their schematics are floating around on the internet these days</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The schematics indicate that onboard RAM data bit 11 is supplied by U28, pin 25. It&#8217;s hooked directly to the CPU&#8217;s data bus, which goes to the RAM SIMM slot, the CPU itself, an optional FPU, the PDS slot, one of the ROM chips (U19), and other random chips on the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/max234252/Macintosh_LCIII-Reloaded\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">max1zzz&#8217;s LC III Reloaded replica of the LC III logic board</a>, I was easily able to follow the traces and verify where things were hooked up. Sometimes Bomarc&#8217;s schematics can be a little iffy, so it&#8217;s always good to double check them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confirmed that U28 pin 25 had a connection to the RAM SIMM socket right next to it (pin 55), but it wasn&#8217;t connected to anything else. The ROM chip U19 was the easiest to test against. I also checked that other nearby data lines did indeed have good continuity between the RAM and ROM, so it was just this one data line that was bad. This all made sense and was consistent with the RAM test results. There was definitely a broken trace somewhere. Following along with max1zzz&#8217;s replica board Gerber files, I had a pretty good idea of where the damage was: a cluster of tiny vias near where an electrolytic capacitor had badly leaked. Several of these vias look pretty icky. Also, please ignore my terrible alignment on the replacement tantalum cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiicap.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"951\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiicap-951x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12915\" style=\"aspect-ratio:0.9287219707701344;width:503px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiicap-951x1024.jpg 951w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiicap-279x300.jpg 279w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiicap-768x827.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiicap-1427x1536.jpg 1427w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiicap-1902x2048.jpg 1902w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiicap.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in a hurry to get this Performa running again. Instead of trying to repair the bad trace/via, I opted for a quick bodge wire on the bottom of the board between pin 55 of the RAM SIMM socket and pin 21 of the relevant ROM socket (U19). That was easier than trying to repair a tiny via. I might experiment more with via repair in the future, though!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiibot.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"815\" src=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiibot-1024x815.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12916\" srcset=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiibot-1024x815.jpg 1024w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiibot-300x239.jpg 300w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiibot-768x611.jpg 768w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiibot-1536x1223.jpg 1536w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lciiibot.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the bodge wire in place, my Performa 450 is alive once again! For now, anyway. My board probably still has some issues. That&#8217;s the tricky thing with capacitor leakage. You might think you&#8217;ve cleaned it well, but electrolyte could still be lurking there somewhere, slowly eating away more and more copper. I know some people have had good luck using ultrasonic cleaners, although I hear that they can damage oscillators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re feeling nostalgic and/or have way too much time on your hands, and you&#8217;re comfortable with building MAME from source, you can replicate my successful diagnosis in an emulator using MAME on Linux. Here&#8217;s a quick patch I applied to screw up bit 11 of the RAM on the emulated LC III:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: diff; title: ; notranslate\">\ndiff --git a/src/mame/apple/sonora.cpp b/src/mame/apple/sonora.cpp\nindex 141e3e9950d..7d07addc29e 100644\n--- a/src/mame/apple/sonora.cpp\n+++ b/src/mame/apple/sonora.cpp\n@@ -191,6 +191,9 @@ u32 sonora_device::rom_switch_r(offs_t offset)\n                offs_t memory_mirror = memory_end &amp; ~memory_end;\n \n                space.install_ram(0x00000000, memory_end &amp; ~memory_mirror, memory_mirror, memory_data);\n+               space.install_write_tap(0x0000, 0xffff, &quot;faulty_ram&quot;, &#x5B;&amp;](offs_t offset, u32 &amp;data, u32 mem_mask) {\n+                       data &amp;= ~0x0800;\n+               });\n                m_overlay = false;\n        }\n\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Then, you can run MAME with this command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">./mame maclc3 -window -nomaximize -printer pty</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This allocates a pseudo terminal that acts as the serial port. You may notice that I included <code>-printer</code> instead of <code>-modem</code> in the command, even though the physical port I used is definitely the modem port. That&#8217;s because the current version of MAME as of this writing seems to have them swapped! Sometime in the future when that is fixed, you&#8217;ll likely need to correctly type <code>-modem</code> instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With my patch applied, running MAME like this should give you the startup sound followed immediately by the error sound. Figure out which pseudo-terminal is linked to the port (it was <code>/dev/pts/1</code> on my machine) and open it with your favorite serial program, such as <a href=\"https://salsa.debian.org/minicom-team/minicom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">minicom</a>. You can now type all the commands I used to diagnose the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"675\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12966\" srcset=\"https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.png 675w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-300x238.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, this was a successful use of Apple&#8217;s ROM diagnostics to quickly solve my issue. It was much easier than manually checking continuity of a zillion PCB traces! Back in the day, Apple had a service tool called the <a href=\"https://appletothecore.me/files/1991_techstep.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechStep</a> that was capable of performing some of these diagnostics. <a href=\"https://68kmla.org/bb/threads/recreateing-the-apple-techstep.41293/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">There&#8217;s even a modern clone of it</a>, which happens to also be created by max1zzz. However, I&#8217;m not sure exactly how useful this device would have been for service techs other than as a pass/fail indicator. Wasn&#8217;t Apple&#8217;s policy just to replace full boards, similar to how it is today? Maybe they repaired faulty returned boards and reused them as service part stock. I&#8217;m not sure!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, this wasn&#8217;t my first successful use of the Serial Test Manager. Earlier this year, I also fixed a Performa 410 (LC II) that was experiencing the Chimes of Death. The failure code was 0x30, indicating an Egret error. Egret is the name of the logic board&#8217;s microcontroller that handles the Apple Desktop Bus, battery-backed PRAM, and some power on stuff. After the ROM diagnostics pointed me in that direction, I did a much better job of cleaning the cap leakage around it, and the problem completely went away. So that&#8217;s now two times that this cool functionality has helped me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll talk more about my somewhat special Performa 410 in a future post!</p>\n",

    "content": "<p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/eliben/pycparser\">pycparser</a> is my most widely used open\nsource project (with ~20M daily downloads from PyPI <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-reference-1\">[1]</a>). It's a pure-Python\nparser for the C programming language, producing ASTs inspired by <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html\">Python's\nown</a>. Until very recently, it's\nbeen using <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html\">PLY: Python Lex-Yacc</a> for\nthe core parsing.</p>\n<p>In this post, I'll describe how I collaborated with an LLM coding agent (Codex)\nto help me rewrite pycparser to use a hand-written recursive-descent parser and\nremove the dependency on PLY. This has been an interesting experience and the\npost contains lots of information and is therefore quite long; if you're just\ninterested in the final result, check out the latest code of pycparser - the\n<tt class=\"docutils literal\">main</tt> branch already has the new implementation.</p>\n<img alt=\"meme picture saying &quot;can't come to bed because my AI agent produced something slightly wrong&quot;\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2026/cantcometobed.png\" />\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-issues-with-the-existing-parser-implementation\">\n<h2>The issues with the existing parser implementation</h2>\n<p>While pycparser has been working well overall, there were a number of nagging\nissues that persisted over years.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"parsing-strategy-yacc-vs-hand-written-recursive-descent\">\n<h3>Parsing strategy: YACC vs. hand-written recursive descent</h3>\n<p>I began working on pycparser in 2008, and back then using a YACC-based approach\nfor parsing a whole language like C seemed like a no-brainer to me. Isn't this\nwhat everyone does when writing a serious parser? Besides, the K&amp;R2 book\nfamously carries the entire grammar of the C99 language in an appendix - so it\nseemed like a simple matter of translating that to PLY-yacc syntax.</p>\n<p>And indeed, it wasn't <em>too</em> hard, though there definitely were some complications\nin building the ASTs for declarations (C's <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2008/10/18/implementing-cdecl-with-pycparser\">gnarliest part</a>).</p>\n<p>Shortly after completing pycparser, I got more and more interested in compilation\nand started learning about the different kinds of parsers more seriously. Over\ntime, I grew convinced that <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/recursive-descent-parsing\">recursive descent</a> is the way to\ngo - producing parsers that are easier to understand and maintain (and are often\nfaster!).</p>\n<p>It all ties in to the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/benefits-of-dependencies-in-software-projects-as-a-function-of-effort/\">benefits of dependencies in software projects as a\nfunction of effort</a>.\nUsing parser generators is a heavy <em>conceptual</em> dependency: it's really nice\nwhen you have to churn out many parsers for small languages. But when you have\nto maintain a single, very complex parser, as part of a large project - the\nbenefits quickly dissipate and you're left with a substantial dependency that\nyou constantly grapple with.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-other-issue-with-dependencies\">\n<h3>The other issue with dependencies</h3>\n<p>And then there are the usual problems with dependencies; dependencies get\nabandoned, and they may also develop security issues. Sometimes, both of these\nbecome true.</p>\n<p>Many years ago, pycparser forked and started vendoring its own version of PLY.\nThis was part of transitioning pycparser to a dual Python 2/3 code base when PLY\nwas slower to adapt. I believe this was the right decision, since PLY &quot;just\nworked&quot; and I didn't have to deal with active (and very tedious in the Python\necosystem, where packaging tools are replaced faster than dirty socks)\ndependency management.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/issues/588\">this issue</a>\nwas opened for pycparser. It turns out the some old PLY code triggers security\nchecks used by some Linux distributions; while this code was fixed in a later\ncommit of PLY, PLY itself was apparently abandoned and archived in late 2025.\nAnd guess what? That happened in the middle of a large rewrite of the package,\nso re-vendoring the pre-archiving commit seemed like a risky proposition.</p>\n<p>On the issue it was suggested that &quot;hopefully the dependent packages move on to\na non-abandoned parser or implement their own&quot;; I originally laughed this idea\noff, but then it got me thinking... which is what this post is all about.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"growing-complexity-of-parsing-a-messy-language\">\n<h3>Growing complexity of parsing a messy language</h3>\n<p>The original K&amp;R2 grammar for C99 had - famously - a single shift-reduce\nconflict having to do with dangling <tt class=\"docutils literal\">else</tt>s belonging to the most recent\n<tt class=\"docutils literal\">if</tt> statement. And indeed, other than the famous <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer_hack\">lexer hack</a>\nused to deal with <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/05/02/the-context-sensitivity-of-cs-grammar-revisited\">C's type name / ID ambiguity</a>,\npycparser only had this single shift-reduce conflict.</p>\n<p>But things got more complicated. Over the years, features were added that\nweren't strictly in the standard but were supported by all the industrial\ncompilers. The more advanced C11 and C23 standards weren't beholden to the\npromises of conflict-free YACC parsing (since almost no industrial-strength\ncompilers use YACC at this point), so all caution went out of the window.</p>\n<p>The latest (PLY-based) release of pycparser has many reduce-reduce conflicts\n<a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-reference-2\">[2]</a>; these are a severe maintenance hazard because it means the parsing rules\nessentially have to be tie-broken by order of appearance in the code. This is\nvery brittle; pycparser has only managed to maintain its stability and quality\nthrough its comprehensive test suite. Over time, it became harder and harder to\nextend, because YACC parsing rules have all kinds of spooky-action-at-a-distance\neffects. The straw that broke the camel's back was <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/pull/590\">this PR</a> which again proposed to\nincrease the number of reduce-reduce conflicts <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-reference-3\">[3]</a>.</p>\n<p>This - again - prompted me to think &quot;what if I just dump YACC and switch to\na hand-written recursive descent parser&quot;, and here we are.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-mental-roadblock\">\n<h2>The mental roadblock</h2>\n<p>None of the challenges described above are new; I've been pondering them for\nmany years now, and yet biting the bullet and rewriting the parser didn't feel\nlike something I'd like to get into. By my private estimates it'd take at least\na week of deep heads-down work to port the gritty 2000 lines of YACC grammar\nrules to a recursive descent parser <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-reference-4\">[4]</a>. Moreover, it wouldn't be a\nparticularly <em>fun</em> project either - I didn't feel like I'd learn much new and\nmy interests have shifted away from this project. In short, the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_well\">Potential well</a> was just too deep.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"why-would-this-even-work-tests\">\n<h2>Why would this even work? Tests</h2>\n<p>I've definitely noticed the improvement in capabilities of LLM coding\nagents in the past few months, and many reputable people online rave about using\nthem for increasingly larger projects. That said, would an LLM agent really be\nable to accomplish such a complex project on its own? This isn't just a toy,\nit's thousands of lines of dense parsing code.</p>\n<p>What gave me hope is the concept of <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#the-year-of-conformance-suites\">conformance suites mentioned by\nSimon Willison</a>.\nAgents seem to do well when there's a very clear and rigid\ngoal function - such as a large, high-coverage conformance test suite.</p>\n<p>And pycparser has an <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/blob/main/tests/test_c_parser.py\">very extensive one</a>.\nOver 2500 lines of test code parsing various C snippets to ASTs with expected\nresults, grown over a decade and a half of real issues and bugs reported by\nusers.</p>\n<p>I figured the LLM can either succeed or fail and throw its hands up in despair,\nbut it's quite unlikely to produce a <em>wrong</em> port that would still pass all\nthe tests. So I set it to run.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-initial-port\">\n<h2>The initial port</h2>\n<p>I fired up Codex in pycparser's repository, and wrote this prompt just to\nmake sure it understands me and can run the tests:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>This repository implements a Python parser producing an AST. It has a very\nextensive test suite; can you first verify you successfully run all the tests?\n(with python3 -m unittest discover, from the root dir)\n</pre></div>\n<p>Codex figured it out (I gave it the exact command, after all!); my next\nprompt was the real thing <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-reference-5\">[5]</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>pycparser uses the PLY library for its lexer and parser, and its own AST\npackage for the ASTs created by the parser. I want to explore replacing the\nParser component (leaving the Lexer alone for now) with a hand written\nrecursive descent parser that will pass all the same tests. Can you try that?\n</pre></div>\n<p>Here Codex went to work and churned <em>for over an hour</em>. Having never\nobserved an agent work for nearly this long, I kind of assumed it went off\nthe rails and will fail sooner or later. So I was rather surprised and skeptical\nwhen it eventually came back with:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>Replaced the PLY parse path with a handwritten recursive‑descent parser while\nkeeping the existing lexer and AST helpers intact; CParser now points to the\nnew RD implementation, with the old PLY version preserved as PLYCParser in\npycparser/c_parser.py. The RD parser includes a token stream, declarator/type\nparsing, expression precedence handling, pragmas, and statement parsing to\nmatch the previous AST output and coordinate behavior.\n</pre></div>\n<p>It took me a while to poke around the code and run it until I was convinced - it\nhad actually done it! It wrote a new recursive descent parser with only\nancillary dependencies on PLY, and that parser passed the test suite. After a\nfew more prompts, we've removed the ancillary dependencies and made the\nstructure clearer. I hadn't looked too deeply into code quality at this point,\nbut at least on the functional level - it succeeded. This was very impressive!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"a-quick-note-on-reviews-and-branches\">\n<h2>A quick note on reviews and branches</h2>\n<p>A change like the one described above is impossible to code-review as one PR in\nany meaningful way; so I used a different strategy. Before embarking on this\npath, I created a new branch and once Codex finished the initial rewrite, I\ncommitted this change, knowing that I will review it in detail, piece-by-piece\nlater on.</p>\n<p>Even though coding agents have their own notion of history and can &quot;revert&quot;\ncertain changes, I felt much safer relying on Git. In the worst case if all of\nthis goes south, I can nuke the branch and it's as if nothing ever happened.\nI was determined to only merge this branch onto <tt class=\"docutils literal\">main</tt> once I was fully\nsatisfied with the code. In what follows, I had to <tt class=\"docutils literal\">git reset</tt> several times\nwhen I didn't like the direction in which Codex was going. In hindsight, doing\nthis work in a branch was absolutely the right choice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-long-tail-of-goofs\">\n<h2>The long tail of goofs</h2>\n<p>Once I've sufficiently convinced myself that the new parser is actually working,\nI used Codex to similarly rewrite the lexer and get rid of the PLY dependency\nentirely, deleting it from the repository. Then, I started looking more deeply\ninto code quality - reading the code created by Codex and trying to wrap my head\naround it.</p>\n<p>And - oh my - this was quite the journey. Much has been written about the code\nproduced by agents, and much of it seems to be true. Maybe it's a setting I'm\nmissing (I'm not using my own custom <tt class=\"docutils literal\">AGENTS.md</tt> yet, for instance), but\nCodex seems to be that eager programmer that wants to get from A to B whatever\nthe cost. Readability, minimalism and code clarity are very much secondary\ngoals.</p>\n<p>Using <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">raise...except</span></tt> for control flow? Yep. Abusing Python's weak typing\n(like having <tt class=\"docutils literal\">None</tt>, <tt class=\"docutils literal\">false</tt> and other values all mean different things\nfor a given variable)? For sure. Spreading the logic of a complex function\nall over the place instead of putting all the key parts in a single switch\nstatement? You bet.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the agent is hilariously <em>lazy</em>. More than once I had to convince it\nto do something it initially said is impossible, and even insisted again in\nfollow-up messages. The anthropomorphization here is mildly concerning, to be\nhonest. I could never imagine I would be writing something like the following to\na computer, and yet - here we are: &quot;Remember how we moved X to Y before? You\ncan do it again for Z, definitely. Just try&quot;.</p>\n<p>My process was to see how I can instruct Codex to fix things, and intervene\nmyself (by rewriting code) as little as possible. I've <em>mostly</em> succeeded in\nthis, and did maybe 20% of the work myself.</p>\n<p>My branch grew <em>dozens</em> of commits, falling into roughly these categories:</p>\n<ol class=\"arabic simple\">\n<li>The code in X is too complex; why can't we do Y instead?</li>\n<li>The use of X is needlessly convoluted; change Y to Z, and T to V in all\ninstances.</li>\n<li>The code in X is unclear; please add a detailed comment - with examples - to\nexplain what it does.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Interestingly, after doing (3), the agent was often more effective in giving\nthe code a &quot;fresh look&quot; and succeeding in either (1) or (2).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-end-result\">\n<h2>The end result</h2>\n<p>Eventually, after many hours spent in this process, I was reasonably pleased\nwith the code. It's far from perfect, of course, but taking the essential\ncomplexities into account, it's something I could see myself maintaining (with\nor without the help of an agent). I'm sure I'll find more ways to improve it\nin the future, but I have a reasonable degree of confidence that this will be\ndoable.</p>\n<p>It passes all the tests, so I've been able to release a new version (3.00)\nwithout major issues so far. The only issue I've discovered is that some of\nCFFI's tests are overly precise about the phrasing of errors reported by\npycparser; this was <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/python-cffi/cffi/pull/224\">an easy fix</a>.</p>\n<p>The new parser is also faster, by about 30% based on my benchmarks! This is\ntypical of recursive descent when compared with YACC-generated parsers, in my\nexperience. After reviewing the initial rewrite of the lexer, I've spent a while\ninstructing Codex on how to make it faster, and it worked reasonably well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"followup-static-typing\">\n<h2>Followup - static typing</h2>\n<p>While working on this, it became quite obvious that static typing would make the\nprocess easier. LLM coding agents really benefit from closed loops with strict\nguardrails (e.g. a test suite to pass), and type-annotations act as such.\nFor example, had pycparser already been type annotated, Codex would probably not\nhave overloaded values to multiple types (like <tt class=\"docutils literal\">None</tt> vs. <tt class=\"docutils literal\">False</tt> vs.\nothers).</p>\n<p>In a followup, I asked Codex to type-annotate pycparser (running checks using\n<tt class=\"docutils literal\">ty</tt>), and this was also a back-and-forth because the process exposed some\nissues that needed to be refactored. Time will tell, but hopefully it will make\nfurther changes in the project simpler for the agent.</p>\n<p>Based on this experience, I'd bet that coding agents will be somewhat more\neffective in strongly typed languages like Go, TypeScript and especially Rust.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"conclusions\">\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Overall, this project has been a really good experience, and I'm impressed with\nwhat modern LLM coding agents can do! While there's no reason to expect that\nprogress in this domain will stop, even if it does - these are already very\nuseful tools that can significantly improve programmer productivity.</p>\n<p>Could I have done this myself, without an agent's help? Sure. But it would have\ntaken me <em>much</em> longer, assuming that I could even muster the will and\nconcentration to engage in this project. I estimate it would take me at least\na week of full-time work (so 30-40 hours) spread over who knows how long to\naccomplish. With Codex, I put in an order of magnitude less work into this\n(around 4-5 hours, I'd estimate) and I'm happy with the result.</p>\n<p>It was also <em>fun</em>. At least in one sense, my professional life can be described\nas the pursuit of focus, deep work and <em>flow</em>. It's not easy for me to get into\nthis state, but when I do I'm highly productive and find it very enjoyable.\nAgents really help me here. When I know I need to write some code and it's\nhard to get started, asking an agent to write a prototype is a great catalyst\nfor my motivation. Hence the meme at the beginning of the post.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"does-code-quality-even-matter\">\n<h3>Does code quality even matter?</h3>\n<p>One can't avoid a nagging question - does the quality of the code produced\nby agents even matter? Clearly, the agents themselves can understand it (if not\ntoday's agent, then at least next year's). Why worry about future\nmaintainability if the agent can maintain it? In other words, does it make sense\nto just go full vibe-coding?</p>\n<p>This is a fair question, and one I don't have an answer to. Right now, for\nprojects I maintain and <em>stand behind</em>, it seems obvious to me that the code\nshould be fully understandable and accepted by me, and the agent is just a tool\nhelping me get to that state more efficiently. It's hard to say what the future\nholds here; it's going to interesting, for sure.</p>\n<hr class=\"docutils\" />\n<table class=\"docutils footnote\" frame=\"void\" id=\"footnote-1\" rules=\"none\">\n<colgroup><col class=\"label\" /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n<tr><td class=\"label\"><a class=\"fn-backref\" href=\"#footnote-reference-1\">[1]</a></td><td>pycparser has a fair number of <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://deps.dev/pypi/pycparser/3.0.0/dependents\">direct dependents</a>,\nbut the majority of downloads comes through <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/python-cffi/cffi\">CFFI</a>,\nwhich itself is a major building block for much of the Python ecosystem.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"docutils footnote\" frame=\"void\" id=\"footnote-2\" rules=\"none\">\n<colgroup><col class=\"label\" /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n<tr><td class=\"label\"><a class=\"fn-backref\" href=\"#footnote-reference-2\">[2]</a></td><td>The table-building report says 177, but that's certainly an\nover-dramatization because it's common for a single conflict to\nmanifest in several ways.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"docutils footnote\" frame=\"void\" id=\"footnote-3\" rules=\"none\">\n<colgroup><col class=\"label\" /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n<tr><td class=\"label\"><a class=\"fn-backref\" href=\"#footnote-reference-3\">[3]</a></td><td>It didn't help the PR's case that it was almost certainly vibe coded.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"docutils footnote\" frame=\"void\" id=\"footnote-4\" rules=\"none\">\n<colgroup><col class=\"label\" /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n<tr><td class=\"label\"><a class=\"fn-backref\" href=\"#footnote-reference-4\">[4]</a></td><td><p class=\"first\">There was also the lexer to consider, but this seemed like a much\nsimpler job.

The 1996 Apple Network Server is one of Apple's more noteworthy white elephants and, to date, the last non-Macintosh computer (iOS devices notwithstanding) to come from Cupertino. Best known for being about the size of a generous dorm fridge and officially only running AIX 4.1, IBM's proprietary Unix for Power ISA, <a href=\"/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html\">its complicated history</a> is a microcosm of some of Apple's strangest days during the mid-1990s. At $10,000+ a pop (in 2026 dollars over $20,700), not counting the AIX license, they sold poorly and were among the first products on the chopping block when Steve Jobs returned in 1997.\n<p>\n<tt>stockholm</tt>, my own Apple Network Server 500, was a castoff I got in 1998 &mdash; practically new &mdash; when the University bookstore's vendor wouldn't support the hardware and it got surplused. It was the first Unix server I ever owned personally, over the years I ended up installing nearly every available upgrade, and it ran Floodgap.com just about nonstop until I replaced it with a POWER6 in 2012 (for which it still functions as an emergency reserve). Plus, as the University was still running RS/6000 systems back then, I had ready access to tons of AIX software which the ANS ran flawlessly. It remains one of the jewels of my collection.\n<p>\nSo when <a href=\"/2025/10/the-apple-network-server-macos-roms.html\">the mythical ANS MacOS ROM finally surfaced</a>, I was <em>very</em> interested. There had always been interest in getting the ANS to run MacOS back in the day (I remember wasting an afternoon trying with a Mac OS 8 CD) and it was a poorly-kept secret that at various points in its development it could, given its hardware basis as a heavily modified Power Macintosh 9500. Apple itself perceived this interest, even demonstrating it with Mac OS prior to its release, and leading then-CTO Ellen Hancock to later announce that the ANS would get ROM upgrades to allow it to run both regular Mac OS and, in a shock to the industry, Windows NT. This would have made the ANS the first and only Apple machine ever sold to support it.\n<p>\nWell, guess what. This is <em>that</em> pre-production ROM Apple originally used to demonstrate Mac OS, and another individual has stepped up with the NT ROMs which are also now in my possession. However, at that time it wasn't clear what the prototype ROM stick was &mdash; just a whole bunch of flash chips on a Power Mac ROM DIMM which my Apple contacts tell me was used to develop many other machines at the time &mdash; and there was no way I was sticking it into my beloved production 500. But we have a solution for that. Network Servers came in three sizes: the rackmount ANS 300 (\"Deep Dish\") which was never released except for a small number of prototypes, the baseline ANS 500 (\"Shiner LE\"), and the highest tier ANS 700 (\"Shiner HE\") which added more drive bays and redundant, hot-swappable power supplies.\n<p>\nWhich brings us to <em>this</em> machine.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhMVaBYHPfG42ajSg-fJUO4Q2CUg9A4bjBzJaTcp4EPsMKScRrSAGFIsruOfx5yfiUK1L0LU9M100LMx7-aZzRhH5IUJjpyJH0DXVp43Ffz5RusjPhtSCUP5O4xHHLLtP0D8zAYqM4KZNncqmT-h_6XdDjLcQaHilQonlTBoxq1mVBrsaak6BBNEu-9KE/s4080/PXL_20260116_185146129.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhMVaBYHPfG42ajSg-fJUO4Q2CUg9A4bjBzJaTcp4EPsMKScRrSAGFIsruOfx5yfiUK1L0LU9M100LMx7-aZzRhH5IUJjpyJH0DXVp43Ffz5RusjPhtSCUP5O4xHHLLtP0D8zAYqM4KZNncqmT-h_6XdDjLcQaHilQonlTBoxq1mVBrsaak6BBNEu-9KE/s320/PXL_20260116_185146129.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nMeet <tt>holmstock</tt>, my Network Server 700, and the second ANS in my collection (the third is my non-functional <a href=\"/2021/10/shiner-esb-apple-network-server.html\">Shiner ESB prototype</a>). This was a ship of Theseus that my friend CB and I assembled out of two partially working but rather thrashed 700s we got for \"come and get them\" in August 2003. It served as <tt>stockholm</tt>'s body double for a number of years until <tt>stockholm</tt> was retired and <tt>holmstock</tt> went into cold storage as a holding bay for spare parts. This makes it the perfect system to try a dodgy ROM in.\n<p>\nI'll give you a spoiler now: it turns out the NT ROM isn't enough to install Windows NT by itself, even though it has some interesting attributes. Sadly this was not unexpected. But the pre-production ROM does work to boot Mac OS, albeit with apparent bugs and an injection of extra hardware. Let's get the 700 running again (call it a Refurb Weekend) and show the process.\n<p>\n<a name='more'></a>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqOm5MX18DbKwan2N976oZXezEY3gEKwrJPYcg1-JXf184g40WrsP9BLQVKJKgRa3pQRXRwZx3LIZs5mKdpHmllZoZMaj0tqvOp880G42bAfrR1pzKI1vPm4b23g1VmTe0d_Ty1bYAgCQp4USmKLN6svgpeufVgzPUYNFELY2BrHLOowHAnInsuGEmlMU/s4080/PXL_20260116_185546542.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqOm5MX18DbKwan2N976oZXezEY3gEKwrJPYcg1-JXf184g40WrsP9BLQVKJKgRa3pQRXRwZx3LIZs5mKdpHmllZoZMaj0tqvOp880G42bAfrR1pzKI1vPm4b23g1VmTe0d_Ty1bYAgCQp4USmKLN6svgpeufVgzPUYNFELY2BrHLOowHAnInsuGEmlMU/s320/PXL_20260116_185546542.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nThe 700 weighs around 85 pounds unloaded and is exactly like trying to cram a refrigerator into the backseat of your car (in this case my Honda Civic Si). While it does have wheels on the bottom, even the good ones don't have a great turning radius (and these aren't good), and getting it in and out of the car unavoidably means having to pick it up. Lift with your knees, not with your back.\n<p>\n<h3>Preparing the 700 for testing</h3>\n<p>\nThis section is basically a cloaked Refurb Weekend, but even if you're familiar with ANS guts, I'm going to point out a few specific things relevant to ROM support as we go along. We want this machine as ship-shape as we can get it so that accurate observations can be made for posterity!\n<p>\nI would also like to thank my wife who chose to politely ignore the new noisy beast hulking in the living room for a few days.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTNgk3wZJFSwWRMGDozfZIQBXwDJsKIVTd2sGTyxMw0x7tUuPToOfitm6GNj9jNXawXZ46riEZDZrUPSfVhuMJ6nET9dVXw1CLgwIDoQeGn2jOn5AAtTAjtsb0BOlJyYpsMcTYPsUj5pyXYoqiV14HL3zMY1dl6YQDBwWzMHVCGULFRAaYwaoJ25P6dVQ/s4080/PXL_20260119_160656307.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" data-original-height=\"4080\" data-original-width=\"3072\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTNgk3wZJFSwWRMGDozfZIQBXwDJsKIVTd2sGTyxMw0x7tUuPToOfitm6GNj9jNXawXZ46riEZDZrUPSfVhuMJ6nET9dVXw1CLgwIDoQeGn2jOn5AAtTAjtsb0BOlJyYpsMcTYPsUj5pyXYoqiV14HL3zMY1dl6YQDBwWzMHVCGULFRAaYwaoJ25P6dVQ/s320/PXL_20260119_160656307.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nContinuing in the fridge motif, the 500 and 700 have a front keylock controlling a sliding door, along with a unique 4-line LCD which displays boot information and can be used as an output device in AIX and other operating systems. Unlike my very minimally yellowed 500 which has spent most of its life in quiet smoke-free server rooms, this one seemed to have gotten a bit more sun. Fortunately most of the chassis is painted metal which is also where most of the weight comes from. The keylock position on power-up is noted by the firmware; the leftmost is the service setting, the middle is a normal boot, and the rightmost (locked) position puts the machine into a power failsafe mode.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBW13uOao5Euzz-38h8h2lQheYHT9v4G89gdjlMFZqqREC6Ml5Vyiy9DNQubGJILLBiWqHi3FCKjZI1728sTuy7YGNQshAxWxoAL_RArmCFJ7n8QXjLO4BQTHD4PFFlFdG2qb9Ld5HkxjCLf74IA1URztfMDbEtoSUOGxpYtTqyn_Is17qa33UsFbhRYk/s4080/PXL_20260116_202020957.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" data-original-height=\"4080\" data-original-width=\"3072\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBW13uOao5Euzz-38h8h2lQheYHT9v4G89gdjlMFZqqREC6Ml5Vyiy9DNQubGJILLBiWqHi3FCKjZI1728sTuy7YGNQshAxWxoAL_RArmCFJ7n8QXjLO4BQTHD4PFFlFdG2qb9Ld5HkxjCLf74IA1URztfMDbEtoSUOGxpYtTqyn_Is17qa33UsFbhRYk/s320/PXL_20260116_202020957.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nThe sliding door covers seven front drive bays, normally one with a CD-ROM, one with some sort of tape drive (typically a DAT/DDS drive, but a few have 8mm tape instead, both the same drives as sold for the Workgroup Server 95 and 9150), and the rest various hard drives which can be either independent or connected into an optional RAID. The 700 can take two more drives in a rear bracket. Although I have the RAID card, I never ended up installing it since a single drive was more than sufficient for what I was using it for. As most of the drive trays and both drive brackets had been removed from the two donor 700s used to assemble <tt>holmstock</tt>, I ended up just keeping a CD-ROM and two trays, and used the other open space for storage.\n<p>\nAt the top are the NMI, reset and power buttons, plus a standard Mac floppy drive.\n<p>\nIt is worth noting here that the internal bays are all serviced by two Symbios Logic 53C825A controllers, providing two Fast Wide SCSI busses running at 20MB/s. Unlike the typical Power Mac MESH (10MB/s) controller, the ANS internal SCSI controllers are unique to the ANS and appear in no other Apple product. Remember this for later. A second external SCSI bus is available on the rear, using the same (slower 5MB/s) CURIO SCSI/Ethernet/serial combo chip as other contemporary Power Macs and implementing an NCR 53C94.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwXDjU39qSxQsBZNg6_SjGM7LXNPA_WRo2hljzQMPRhPB9x86csbChYnvpJ7kKjHzmHxKdj0pDsUvAvjYt1NtR3b2FhZ9q0iVqFPqdY15SJ8dthJjep-piI2WRXmqjvwf9toHFxHniClOAKUTZvwk2hpjrBZd6N_i6KnDLYKFuiyVB586UBU9ITgGNUcc/s4080/PXL_20260116_205718019.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" data-original-height=\"4080\" data-original-width=\"3072\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwXDjU39qSxQsBZNg6_SjGM7LXNPA_WRo2hljzQMPRhPB9x86csbChYnvpJ7kKjHzmHxKdj0pDsUvAvjYt1NtR3b2FhZ9q0iVqFPqdY15SJ8dthJjep-piI2WRXmqjvwf9toHFxHniClOAKUTZvwk2hpjrBZd6N_i6KnDLYKFuiyVB586UBU9ITgGNUcc/s320/PXL_20260116_205718019.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nThe rear (with the monitor power cable photobombing the shot) is much less yellowed. Ports are here for audio in and out (standard <a href=\"/2022/12/the-strange-case-of-beos-srs-and-silent.html\">AWACS</a>), ADB, two beige Mac MiniDIN-8 serial ports, VGA (oddly but happily a conventional HDI-15, not Apple's traditional DA-15), AAUI 10Mbit Ethernet (any AAUI Mac dongle will work), and the external SCSI bus DB-25. Six PCI slots are available. A second keylock secures the logic board which is on a slide-out drawer accessed with the two handles. Both rear panels have their own fans which are hot-swappable as well. Apple included a monitor dongle in the box.\n<p>\nIt is also worth noting here that the onboard video is a Cirrus Logic 54M30, also unique to the ANS, and likewise also used in no other Apple product.

They are wafer-lock keys of the same type used in the Quadra 950, Apple Workgroup Server 95 and Workgroup Server 9150. As sold Network Servers came with three keys, one front, one back and one spare, but they are all interchangeable. These keys have a small three-digit code engraved into the metal identifying the lock they are designed to fit.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoTHm5aMlb2xKVz5X9_C-JZCdBTqHanvRf6n_iGKPwY85sbsAht6W-5GONgyfX3r-ynBL3ian_oUS-y5M_V1OrGFpBH5d_Bq_wjXHQhRJ9d_3eW5Ueoi3B_8Nfpe1av75hH2Qru9rAwmpeFoiqcQQoqk0She1_OTQyfapi4DJXiel8La01akC5u351xhk/s4080/PXL_20260116_203237827.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoTHm5aMlb2xKVz5X9_C-JZCdBTqHanvRf6n_iGKPwY85sbsAht6W-5GONgyfX3r-ynBL3ian_oUS-y5M_V1OrGFpBH5d_Bq_wjXHQhRJ9d_3eW5Ueoi3B_8Nfpe1av75hH2Qru9rAwmpeFoiqcQQoqk0She1_OTQyfapi4DJXiel8La01akC5u351xhk/s320/PXL_20260116_203237827.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nI also got out a lot of parts from storage just in case they were needed, some of which were in the 700 and some of which were separate. Besides my two boxes of tricks, I also pulled out a spare logic board, five boxes of RAM upgrade kits (these are only 16MB each, though, so this isn't as much memory as you'd think), a 200MHz CPU upgrade kit, several more loose CPUs I also have, and a RAID card just for fun.\n<p>\nI dimly recalled the machine may not have been working right when I committed it to storage, but we'll proceed as if it had been, starting with a visual inspection of the electronics.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiE4D23TYdzhm2rpaFyVmXB9rjtCwCV0NUDjyBIa2KFG33-5BN798bZhybVE49uAxy_E2haO7Iuybqu13Do0w-hBSq1hu4XQInhfCKtX7QX1S0tskV7Q10EQHK4m4KplGr9ncuqHBTN745rgbIHJVrwwTRDKm5pTH9erm3M9ZO6UjLMwC-r2sIN8G1FVPs/s4080/PXL_20260116_220842172.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiE4D23TYdzhm2rpaFyVmXB9rjtCwCV0NUDjyBIa2KFG33-5BN798bZhybVE49uAxy_E2haO7Iuybqu13Do0w-hBSq1hu4XQInhfCKtX7QX1S0tskV7Q10EQHK4m4KplGr9ncuqHBTN745rgbIHJVrwwTRDKm5pTH9erm3M9ZO6UjLMwC-r2sIN8G1FVPs/s320/PXL_20260116_220842172.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nThe keylock on the logic board drawer (shown here with the rear panel off so you can see how it operates) has just two positions. In the horizontal locked position, the board is connected to power and a metal tab prevents the drawer from coming out. In the vertical unlocked position, the board is disconnected and the tab is moved away from the chassis so the drawer can be pulled free. We turn the rear key, grab the handles and pull the board drawer out.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLsGsJpE7cfagaWJvsrQN3x4MqqgazgeLk8SIyJj1ML_uRtwd8RJQM0Nx7ncwLTBreySBLY91LEm67foTHuoB7-Prpcts1o6FRNQ-BwBohx-lxFLENNZg8rf82Vw-8H_Di7lhKkJ8eTeTKZviNTdV9MOkWjitQbuZYDjOyTpT38UENmTgCbdCl5URclzY/s4080/PXL_20260116_084624293.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"320\" data-original-height=\"4080\" data-original-width=\"3072\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLsGsJpE7cfagaWJvsrQN3x4MqqgazgeLk8SIyJj1ML_uRtwd8RJQM0Nx7ncwLTBreySBLY91LEm67foTHuoB7-Prpcts1o6FRNQ-BwBohx-lxFLENNZg8rf82Vw-8H_Di7lhKkJ8eTeTKZviNTdV9MOkWjitQbuZYDjOyTpT38UENmTgCbdCl5URclzY/s320/PXL_20260116_084624293.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nThis is the logic board (the spare in the bag). It has a broadly similar layout to other six-slot Power Macs and has many of the same chips, including a Grand Central (labeled I/O CNTRL, near the Cirrus Logic video ASIC), CURIO (labeled SCSI/ENET) and two Bandits (labeled as PCI BRIDGEs). However, it only has eight RAM DIMM slots instead of the 9500's twelve, and most of the system connections are consolidated into a single card edge at the top and a large power connector at the bottom. There are separate slots for the ROM DIMM, the CPU daughtercard and the L2 cache. Headers handle both internal SCSI busses, the mainboard fan and the rear keylock. A small red CUDA reset button is at the top left.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK5GqP1-GtZtnWcki_tOJqaIKZzA2pB3YvLZ_qdCA_6xQBtQlLsBkQOpyAtgCld8a1i_esTEScykidIIU8-M90TOtZt7CBV0XcVWNh1JXGPZKSu5oVothUDcO8Gp41aIZp8sQ67VTHHQ81_F28ISNjYFPaBA4ucnKdKZAPPcj-xLt4PmpqFfPCHF_-1BQ/s4080/PXL_20260116_202028703.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK5GqP1-GtZtnWcki_tOJqaIKZzA2pB3YvLZ_qdCA_6xQBtQlLsBkQOpyAtgCld8a1i_esTEScykidIIU8-M90TOtZt7CBV0XcVWNh1JXGPZKSu5oVothUDcO8Gp41aIZp8sQ67VTHHQ81_F28ISNjYFPaBA4ucnKdKZAPPcj-xLt4PmpqFfPCHF_-1BQ/s320/PXL_20260116_202028703.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nInstalled, the board sits in front of the mainboard fan which is primarily used to cool the CPU daughtercard. This daughtercard rides in plastic rails that serve as alignment guides and structural support. Tabs and a couple mounting screws hold the logic board in place in the drawer. The tabs, card rails and much of the drawer itself are unfortunately made from Amelioplastic, but this drawer is thick and not normally exposed to the exterior, and it mercifully remains in good physical condition. Note that when the drawer is open, the board is completely ungrounded, so only handle it with antistatic precautions.\n<p>\nI never store machines with their PRAM batteries installed (especially since my Shiner ESB prototype had been ruined by the previous owner doing so, during which time it leaked and corroded the logic board), but in this particular case since we will be messing with the system it is easier to reset the logic board if we never install the battery at all. With the machine unplugged, the battery out and the rear key unlocked (horizontal), the board will be completely depowered and will reset in about three minutes or so.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMV73O38xrfDtNWh4s4NbkbwX_PORhLd8bGMPFBs8TpTpn9EE_uWlb9iKXmYkMcqWMUGU6dIS8QpRw6tPxnWxUqgt-5ep1yNUKETyP5Wm_Zx4N5UcWYBZxuT9NqBABH54IsFcTccX037gk0J8Y1UEryYzEZ-hWAcOVgXWi99RAXEgOrUIQSI3Wl-HPurI/s4080/PXL_20260116_202130778~2.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMV73O38xrfDtNWh4s4NbkbwX_PORhLd8bGMPFBs8TpTpn9EE_uWlb9iKXmYkMcqWMUGU6dIS8QpRw6tPxnWxUqgt-5ep1yNUKETyP5Wm_Zx4N5UcWYBZxuT9NqBABH54IsFcTccX037gk0J8Y1UEryYzEZ-hWAcOVgXWi99RAXEgOrUIQSI3Wl-HPurI/s320/PXL_20260116_202130778~2.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nThe CPU card is much larger than the ones used in most other PCI Power Macs and was intended to accommodate a dual-processor SMP option which was never sold, though again some prototypes have escaped (I would love to get one). Unfortunately this means that Power Mac CPU cards can't upgrade an ANS and the highest-speed option is the 200MHz 604e card shown here, but any ANS CPU card will work in any ANS, so <tt>stockholm</tt> also has a 200MHz card. Bus speed and CPU speed are related: the 132MHz (base 500) and 176MHz 604 cards run the bus at 44MHz, but the 150MHz 604 (base 700) and 200MHz 604e cards run the bus at 50MHz.\n<p>\nAt the top is the 700's standard 1MB L2 cache (the 500 came with 512K). These are allegedly regular Power Mac caches, and a Network Server 1MB cache should work in other Power Macs, but the 500 kernel-panicked with a Sonnet L2 cache upgrade and I eventually had to chase down a 1MB card pulled from another 700.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgr99lWxrUYGRWtZauS_Im-WK0Y0phSOU59SIRORkbNBOS2s0nExKpHwHDibJgyStt9rx_c-NXkJ2GVLEByGKSafjK7A09JqvSxCYDQTe7Y0GfH8LtWFfmPW_FgaNDEnjXl1JTcxIcBKrTIWkDLwFgfTCvHWDNWcHAoRIKK0RnXGD3WQCzYy3F8QBZpvtc/s4080/PXL_20260119_155927422.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgr99lWxrUYGRWtZauS_Im-WK0Y0phSOU59SIRORkbNBOS2s0nExKpHwHDibJgyStt9rx_c-NXkJ2GVLEByGKSafjK7A09JqvSxCYDQTe7Y0GfH8LtWFfmPW_FgaNDEnjXl1JTcxIcBKrTIWkDLwFgfTCvHWDNWcHAoRIKK0RnXGD3WQCzYy3F8QBZpvtc/s320/PXL_20260119_155927422.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nBehind that is the ROM stick and the centrepiece of this article.

The ANS uses the same 168-pin DIMMs as other Power Macs and can accept up to 512MB (anything greater is not supported by the memory controller), but uniquely needs 60ns <em>parity</em> RAM for highest performance. If <em>any</em> DIMM is not parity, then the system ROM disables parity for <em>all</em> DIMMs <em>and</em> sets the timing to 70ns, even if the RAM is faster. This is a non-trivial hit, especially at the fastest 50MHz bus speed, so you really want parity if you can get it. Here I'm using parity FPM, which was sold standard in the units (all units came with at least 32MB in two 16MB DIMMs) and in upgrade kits (16MB in two 8MB DIMMs), all manufactured by IBM as OEM under contract and sold at typically exorbitant Apple prices. \n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhX2QsdgOp74oCI-si_xgtG2_BTy5bUx6SKTPmF3_OvOjYHMyjWLlGi2qC3vvFAvnA0iA2gl7UkUIcFlLoyYfLKGGeicR__YeUOa7mKqYrJUJE_HKJj2S3lo-kWbHfaJym5LyPQid3bghy1O5TGEzGj7b0u2wm6F5iiCbabjYUV1h0BWVxuhSiJPPGOuQY/s4080/PXL_20260116_205518211.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhX2QsdgOp74oCI-si_xgtG2_BTy5bUx6SKTPmF3_OvOjYHMyjWLlGi2qC3vvFAvnA0iA2gl7UkUIcFlLoyYfLKGGeicR__YeUOa7mKqYrJUJE_HKJj2S3lo-kWbHfaJym5LyPQid3bghy1O5TGEzGj7b0u2wm6F5iiCbabjYUV1h0BWVxuhSiJPPGOuQY/s320/PXL_20260116_205518211.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nLater on 64MB and 128MB parity DIMMs became available and <tt>stockholm</tt> has a full 512MB from eight 64MB parity sticks.

Typically this is because the processor wormed itself out of the board and needs to be reseated, but you can also get something like this if the card went bad, and less commonly if the ROM stick isn't installed correctly.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxEG5YqrEc1Wk4VmdrOfRLDNv7s6huJrKPBJvJg2cLpFU9Q8KUa-WoZJzUELQU4gzuQxRiioxyn_BcYXAfG6mqCfWbUb1AaYrhE29cLe9-VWP2357Jv42bVd8YFulNnHaG1w7hkXWJVbOHrP6mHJUb7MOO9sSgk_Ybeu-KHG1y49_3_rQt95tAGLZ9Jj0/s4080/PXL_20260116_211737311.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxEG5YqrEc1Wk4VmdrOfRLDNv7s6huJrKPBJvJg2cLpFU9Q8KUa-WoZJzUELQU4gzuQxRiioxyn_BcYXAfG6mqCfWbUb1AaYrhE29cLe9-VWP2357Jv42bVd8YFulNnHaG1w7hkXWJVbOHrP6mHJUb7MOO9sSgk_Ybeu-KHG1y49_3_rQt95tAGLZ9Jj0/s320/PXL_20260116_211737311.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nHowever (moving the monitor cord out of the way), we have a problem: we can't get the drawer to open wide enough to pull out and reseat the CPU card.

You shouldn't need to force it in, though it does need a bit of grunt to ensure both rows of contacts get into the slot.\n<p>\nClosing the drawer likewise doesn't require force <i>per se</i>, but the rear keylock will not turn unless you have the board fully engaged with the mezz and powerplane. There are thumbscrews but they don't really make much difference for this. Sometimes you have to slam it in a couple times, making sure the thumbscrews are completely loosened and out so that they don't get in the way.

In Macs of this generation it was generally invisible to the user except if specifically enabled or requested &mdash; remember this for later as well &mdash; and the Apple Network Server was the earliest Power Mac (well, derived, anyway) system where Open Firmware was explicitly user-facing.

This proves our hardware (and CD-ROM) both work and that its native AIX can start, which means any weird behaviour after this point is more likely than not due to what we're testing.\n<p>\nWe're finally ready to begin. Let's enumerate the currently known Network Server ROMs. In these pre-Open Firmware 3 ROMs, the ROM version and the Open Firmware version are the same. For comparison purposes, PCI Power Macs of this era were typically 1.0.5.\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-production ROMs. Currently one version is known, 1.1.20.1. These were used to boot Mac OS and AIX (and possibly another operating system I'll mention), but the internal video and SCSI controllers are not supported in Mac OS. This was the version that turned out to be on my flash DIMM.</li>\n<li>Production ROMs. Currently one version is known, 1.1.22. These only boot AIX, though systems with these ROMs can also boot NetBSD and certain Linux distributions. I won't talk further about that in this article, but if I were to use a non-AIX operating system on a production ANS, it would almost certainly be NetBSD even though it doesn't currently support internal video or the on-board Ethernet.</li>\n<li>Prototype Mac OS ROMs. Currently one version is known, 2.0. These contain ROM drivers for the internal video and SCSI controllers, and are the only known ROMs to fully support all internal devices in Mac OS. This is not currently in my possession &mdash; though I'd love to get one! &mdash; but at least one person has created replica ROMs from a dump graciously made available by their owner, and then used them to successfully boot their own machine.</li>\n<li>Prototype Windows NT ROMs. These ROMs also appear to be required for multiprocessor support. Currently three versions are known, 2.26b6, 2.26b8 (not dumped, referred to on the LinuxPPC-ANS list) and 2.26NT, with relatively small changes between them.</li>\n<p></ul>\n\nThese ROMs differ primarily in what operating systems they will boot (and, underlyingly, features they add or remove) and devices they contain internal support for. Those differences can be glimpsed by looking at the Forth words the ROM defines and the packages (implemented as pseudo-devices) they carry. For example, here are the packages and devices in this 700 with the production 1.1.22 ROM. The exact addresses are irrelevant for our purposes here except for the addresses of the Bandit PCI bridges, the Hammerhead memory controller and the Toolbox ROM, which are fixed.\n<p>\n<div class=\"tx\"><pre>\ndisk2:aix  \nDevice isn't there! can't OPEN: /bandit/53c825@11/sd@2,0:aixOpenFirmware1.1.22\nTo continue booting from the default boot device type:\nBOOT&lt;return>\n ok\n0 > dev /  ok\n0 > ls \n004308E0: /PowerPC,604@0\n00430B90:   /l2-cache@0,0\n004313F0: /chosen@0\n00431520: /memory@0\n00431668: /openprom@0\n00431728: /AAPL,ROM@FFC00000\n00431968: /options@0\n00431E40: /aliases@0\n00432080: /packages@0\n00432108:   /deblocker@0,0\n004329A8:   /disk-label@0,0\n00432F18:   /obp-tftp@0,0\n00435B28:   /mac-files@0,0\n00436410:   /mac-parts@0,0\n00436D30:   /aix-boot@0,0\n00437488:   /fat-files@0,0\n00438DF0:   /iso-9660-files@0,0\n004398E0:   /xcoff-loader@0,0\n0043A410:   /terminal-emulator@0,0\n0043A4A8: /bandit@F2000000\n0043B500:   /53c825@11\n0043DDE0:     /sd@0,0\n0043EA48:     /st@0,0\n0043F8A8:   /53c825@12\n00442188:     /sd@0,0\n00442DF0:     /st@0,0\n00444288:   /gc@10\n004446C0:     /53c94@10000\n00446460:       /sd@0,0\n00447248:       /st@0,0\n004480C8:     /mace@11000\n00449248:     /escc@13000\n004493A0:       /ch-a@13020\n00449AD8:       /ch-b@13000\n0044A210:     /awacs@14000\n0044A2F8:     /swim3@15000\n0044BB88:     /via-cuda@16000\n0044D088:       /adb@0,0\n0044D178:         /keyboard@0,0\n0044D950:         /mouse@1,0\n0044DA00:       /pram@0,0\n0044DAB0:       /rtc@0,0\n0044DFE0:       /power-mgt@0,0\n0044E1B8:     /nvram@1D000\n00462BC8:     /lcd@1C000\n00450780:   /pci106b,1@B\n00450958:   /54m30@F\n0044E7D0: /bandit@F4000000\n00462350:   /pci106b,1@B\n0044FF28: /hammerhead@F8000000\n ok\n0 > \n</pre></div>\n<p>\nWe'll do the first and last of these in the remainder of this article.

Although NT 3.x and 4.x were designed to be architecture-independent and ran on processors as diverse as MIPS and DEC Alpha as well as 32-bit x86, the PowerPC build had been limited to low-volume IBM hardware and never officially ran on Power Macs. Still, it was clear to Apple that NT would be very important in the industry and felt supporting it would broaden the appeal of the server line &mdash; or at least soften the impact of its sticker price. Importantly, NT support would not have to wait for Apple's then-expected CHRP Power Macs: reworked ROM support could enable the ANS to boot it \"now.\" (In the end, Jobs eventually scuttled the CHRP initiative to starve the Mac clones; the upcoming New World Macs were ultimately an incompatible blend of CHRP and the earlier PReP standard instead.)\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyR5VEQIGAEWmT0jtRxJKtTneAzZEn57x_79Gq7YbVpwCEIg6Hzl_5X6n1-7wwUnPhjOt9N-8ym4X0Zw26cOErNs4tjdkMj4kf2osI5RCK2SYfEqt-G2DeMTb-cfFAfBgtmqvYVTFUJHdd9Qf3Cpv1a4ym9W_6YpCXiyGhV-0hFrOO_kpOjR5hTdIonHk/s4080/PXL_20260117_014152223~2.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyR5VEQIGAEWmT0jtRxJKtTneAzZEn57x_79Gq7YbVpwCEIg6Hzl_5X6n1-7wwUnPhjOt9N-8ym4X0Zw26cOErNs4tjdkMj4kf2osI5RCK2SYfEqt-G2DeMTb-cfFAfBgtmqvYVTFUJHdd9Qf3Cpv1a4ym9W_6YpCXiyGhV-0hFrOO_kpOjR5hTdIonHk/s320/PXL_20260117_014152223~2.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nWhen Jobs talked Gil Amelio into canning the ANS as well, the ROM initiative naturally went out the window with it. However, while the existing 2.0 Mac OS ROMs are only known on an unmarked development flash stick similar to mine, these final 2.26NT ROMs appear almost production-ready with fully printed labels, suggesting they had reached a very late stage of development. (The \"ESB\" tag indicates a prototype designation &mdash; consistent with Shiner, the ANS' <a href=\"/2021/10/shiner-esb-apple-network-server.html\">beer-themed codename during development</a>, ESB stands for \"Extra Special Bitter.\")\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSWdnorTdmwBOdUbEi-epb-9uiHj4USYix44SCvX8CP3r4yC_KOqfQpWpeu3l3htsXygMEUqGda5DMpwdBSiAkbZWucZpy6SDj5deP8PYM4bLBhMdkJ_WMSx4QuVJfRrhqXtvE9zi6c95OSMOGOq_xjyZkKUSyrEeEkmTkcDUju2Gm8tuAkn7CjU5DQ5w/s4080/PXL_20260117_165311174.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSWdnorTdmwBOdUbEi-epb-9uiHj4USYix44SCvX8CP3r4yC_KOqfQpWpeu3l3htsXygMEUqGda5DMpwdBSiAkbZWucZpy6SDj5deP8PYM4bLBhMdkJ_WMSx4QuVJfRrhqXtvE9zi6c95OSMOGOq_xjyZkKUSyrEeEkmTkcDUju2Gm8tuAkn7CjU5DQ5w/s320/PXL_20260117_165311174.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nThese ROMs were kindly sent to me by a former Apple employee at the Elk Grove, CA campus. Sadly this person no longer has the 700 they were running in, but attests to the fact NT did run and apparently even ran well, adding, \"I’m pretty certain that the NT ROM was the Apple business systems team trying to find a way to keep their product from being canceled completely. Motorola had just shipped their PowerStack NT machines a few months previously and they were garbage compared to the ANS when it came to field service and expandability.\" (So true!)\n<p>\nThe NT ROM DIMM simply replaces the production ROM DIMM in the slot. We'll power it up with the front key set to service just in case.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJUo79289SthTcJBxDMd4FmDh0V43RyvrjJLCJDac4iCb_bNKXRrBzjVhQquOGJXw87VDyPG54VtlXL9630_UKp9P0n3BlLoyHDTeDC2lvhiWWCw5AIPVt1aT5use94dqtB7Ox0H-J2Ilm6zP3ROmqIB2fpFavUqm33K5VjzRZwUWPb3_zfJc75lwWLy0/s4080/PXL_20260117_165619257.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJUo79289SthTcJBxDMd4FmDh0V43RyvrjJLCJDac4iCb_bNKXRrBzjVhQquOGJXw87VDyPG54VtlXL9630_UKp9P0n3BlLoyHDTeDC2lvhiWWCw5AIPVt1aT5use94dqtB7Ox0H-J2Ilm6zP3ROmqIB2fpFavUqm33K5VjzRZwUWPb3_zfJc75lwWLy0/s320/PXL_20260117_165619257.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nOn the LCD, not only is the version displayed, but as mentioned this is also one of the ROMs that checks for a second CPU (if we had one of the prototype dual-CPU cards, that is &mdash; contact me, I'm interested if you've got one to get rid of!). \n<p>\nOur first order of business is to immediately dump these ROMs for posterity (they are posted on <a href=\"https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/apple-network-server-macos-based-roms-found.4756/\">the group thread at Tinker Different</a>).

One thing I could find no trace of in the ROM was ARC. We talked about the rise and fall of ARC in <a href=\"/2025/09/refurb-weekend-silicon-graphics-indigo.html\">our SGI Indigo<sup>2</sup> refurb weekend</a>, but even though IBM, Sun, HP, Intel and Apple were never members of the Advanced Computing Environment consortium, Microsoft was. As a consequence virtually any machine capable of booting Windows NT would have some means of system specification through ARC (this particular historical vestige persisted until Windows Vista). On DEC Alphas, this was implemented in firmware, which is why you need the right firmware to boot it; for the IBM Power Series workstations and laptops, the ARC console was on floppy disk. It is highly likely the ANS also had an ARC console of its own, and since it doesn't appear to be in the ROM, there must have been a floppy or CD that provided it which we don't have.\n<p>\nAdditionally, Windows NT relies on a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) which operates between the physical hardware and the rest of the operating system. The HAL is even more lower-level than device drivers, implementing functions like allowing device drivers to access ports in a more standardized fashion, abstracting away interrupt management, and unifying firmware interfaces and DMA. There are HAL DLLs on the 4.0 CD for various IBM (Types 6015, 6020, 6030, and 6070), FirePower (Powerized MX and ES) and Motorola (PowerStack 2 and Big Bend) PowerPC systems, but none for any Power Mac. The HAL necessarily gets loaded early in the setup process, often from another floppy, and you won't be able to successfully bring up Windows NT without it. Although there are apocryphal references to \"halbandit\" out there and this name is likely a reference to the ANS HAL, we don't have it either. (While it should be possible to get <a href=\"https://github.com/Wack0/maciNTosh\">the Windows NT for Power Mac port</a> running on the ANS, per the maintainer its current HAL relies on Mac OS support, so it wouldn't actually be using this ROM.)\n<p>\nDo you have any of these pieces? Post in the comments, or if you'd prefer to be anonymous, drop me an E-mail at ckaiser at floodgap dawt com.\n<p>\nEven without Jobs' looming axe, NT on the ANS was probably ill-starred anyway no matter how well it ran. The unique persistence of Windows NT on the DEC Alpha was a side-effect of primary architect Dave Cutler strongly basing NT on DEC VMS, an aspect hardly lost on DEC's legal team, to the point where various filenames and directory structures in the NT codebase even directly matched those in VMS. To avoid a lawsuit Microsoft paid off DEC, helped promote VMS, and committed to continued support for NT on Alpha, which remained until the beta phase of Windows 2000. This situation was absolutely not the case with PowerPC: IBM was so irked with Microsoft over OS/2 and NT's adoption of an expanded Windows API instead that its support for RISC NT was never more than half-hearted. Likewise, the only MIPS hardware that ran NT were DECstations &mdash; quickly cancelled by DEC in favour of Alpha &mdash; and directly from MIPS, the Magnum R4000 &mdash; also cancelled to avoid competition with Silicon Graphics' IRIX hardware when SGI bought them out. At that point, and already not favourably predisposed to Microsoft's initiative, IBM didn't see any value in continuing to support Windows NT on PowerPC and Amelio's Apple definitely didn't have the resources to do so themselves.\n<p>\n<h3>1.1.20.1 preproduction ROMs</h3>\n<p>\nLet's rewind a bit here and talk about booting Mac OS on the ANS, given that's how all this got started in the first place.

Apple Austin (the address on the box is no longer an Apple building) was the last stand of the Network Server, where a number of systems remained serving content as late as 2005. Per an Apple employee on the LinuxPPC-ANS list in March 2003, \"Our team here at Apple decommissioned over 40 Shiners early last year. They used to be the backbone of the Apple Support site [that is, the former <tt>www.info.apple.com</tt>] serving all the software downloads, all the images for the support site and performing much of the heavy lifting behind the scenes that made our website the highest rated support site in the industry.\" About twenty of them were sold to list members &mdash; I was a starving medical student at the time and couldn't afford either the cash or the space &mdash; but I did make a deal to pick up some of the spare parts.

With that, they got a picture <em>on the video card</em>. No Mac OS support for the internal Fast Wide SCSI nor the Cirrus Logic video is implemented in this ROM, and as we mentioned earlier, having never been used in any prior Apple product, the operating system proper doesn't know what they are either. In fact, the Cirrus Logic video is gimped even in AIX &mdash; the ANS Hardware Developer Notes say that the video controller provides \"only a little-endian window into the packed-pixel frame buffer, hence Big Endian [sic] operating systems are limited to 8 bits per pixel unless low-level transformation routines are written.\"\n<p>\nFor a server that's probably good enough.

There is little hint here that this computer is anything other than a 9500.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYcXrFsQfKtnI-qiiWxTzImYMlYekaEU7vtuVdtGKwJ0js13Mmo0VCjYzkjtjSE-hz5dOejNv59xrH377yFgG4pNg-3NDXJwe-HwWKo32kQjAVJPCaUKWNpjjnnRX_SFY94wie2d3Anuvt_GBODX__W1pvmSZyn8EirO6RTR1tOylSL8DjMFZKvVTlO50/s832/Picture%204.PNG\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"624\" data-original-width=\"832\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYcXrFsQfKtnI-qiiWxTzImYMlYekaEU7vtuVdtGKwJ0js13Mmo0VCjYzkjtjSE-hz5dOejNv59xrH377yFgG4pNg-3NDXJwe-HwWKo32kQjAVJPCaUKWNpjjnnRX_SFY94wie2d3Anuvt_GBODX__W1pvmSZyn8EirO6RTR1tOylSL8DjMFZKvVTlO50/s320/Picture%204.PNG\"/></a></div>\n\nOn the other hand, the PCI slot layout is a little different. Like the 9500 and 9600, the ANS has two Bandits (there is even space in the memory map for a third, which remains unimplemented) and thus two PCI busses, but the 9500/9600 assign <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/unna/mirrors/www.mug.jhmi.edu/mirrors/InfoAlley/0796/02/power.html\">three slots each to each Bandit</a> (Grand Central handling non-PCI devices is on the first). In the ANS, the first Bandit also carries the internal SCSI and internal video as well as Grand Central, so it only handles two slots, with slot 3 going to the second Bandit. This rearrangement manifests here in TattleTech showing just two slots on the first bus.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuYgBI7iqW41O_soRDMhjLC5H7aFnltUU1V15l7sHb86JenCy_PZlqV0ouQRki3_1FHHxaYyujFkHBQj1ksgbGHzuZsK_FAemwHP6ZFWerY-AGBOqB1-_eL8Zmy44MVGGUc0MqxG2eh5_yJtHHg6RhzOppOaZNMhTSwcGwd9_Cm20g1-s3x7A3XxU6Pc8/s832/Picture%205.PNG\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"624\" data-original-width=\"832\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuYgBI7iqW41O_soRDMhjLC5H7aFnltUU1V15l7sHb86JenCy_PZlqV0ouQRki3_1FHHxaYyujFkHBQj1ksgbGHzuZsK_FAemwHP6ZFWerY-AGBOqB1-_eL8Zmy44MVGGUc0MqxG2eh5_yJtHHg6RhzOppOaZNMhTSwcGwd9_Cm20g1-s3x7A3XxU6Pc8/s320/Picture%205.PNG\"/></a></div>\n\nThe ROM checksum also doesn't match. 9500 ROMs contain an Apple checksum of either $96CD923D or $9630C68B (the 9600 might also have $960E4BE9 or $960FC647), but this ROM checksums as $962F6C13. The same checksum appears in the 1.1.22 production ROM, which still contains a substantial portion of the 9500 v2 ROM even though it definitely won't boot Mac OS. This likely represents held-over code that simply no one bothered to remove.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1ZnsxM41qmp4uNipKpuIVnYUqrmJE07ydS1j6OR80DyHKl8dIE1fu5UhrxJkCXEVj3hDOMKki_HLmi0r3Sj7w_qVXreGkGCQzLjjddCOTVSOhRh-BdyEPGUv34L0KW74sT_dYn57C0eu4dhFcJoDfiv4-g6q8ChGXQvD01-ZyOeDfbSHga3iiiBJtcaI/s832/Picture%206.PNG\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"624\" data-original-width=\"832\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1ZnsxM41qmp4uNipKpuIVnYUqrmJE07ydS1j6OR80DyHKl8dIE1fu5UhrxJkCXEVj3hDOMKki_HLmi0r3Sj7w_qVXreGkGCQzLjjddCOTVSOhRh-BdyEPGUv34L0KW74sT_dYn57C0eu4dhFcJoDfiv4-g6q8ChGXQvD01-ZyOeDfbSHga3iiiBJtcaI/s320/Picture%206.PNG\"/></a></div>\n\nWe can also see that the two internal SCSI busses are detected, even if they aren't bootable with this ROM, and they are properly probed as a 53C825.

Recall from our <a href=\"/2023/12/when-power-macintosh-ran-netware.html\">NetWare on Power Macintosh</a> article that the PDMLoader is, at least on NuBus Power Macs, what starts the NWstart kernel and enters NetWare. Among other things it provides a fake Open Firmware environment to allow those Macs to resemble a Shiner ESB unit for demonstration purposes, which was the intended target hardware. Early Shiners reportedly could boot it directly. Unsurprisingly, the PDMLoader checks that it was started on a supported Mac and (based on the Gestalt ID) finds our franken-ANS wanting.\n<p>\nIf we look back at our definition for <tt>setenv-netware</tt>, however, we can see NetWare was expected to run from a so-called \"partition zero\" loader. This is like it sounds: a runnable binary occupies partition zero of a bootable disk, usually XCOFF, and is loaded as blocks into memory by Open Firmware and executed. Unfortunately, the Installer we used for Cyberpunk didn't support creating this, and it wouldn't have been necessary for a NuBus Power Mac anyway which doesn't boot like that. As it's a regular XCOFF binary otherwise, I tried putting <tt>NWstart</tt> onto a plain physical ISO 9660 CD and fed that to 1.1.20.1, but ...\n<p>\n<div class=\"tx\"><pre>\ndisk2:aix  \nDevice isn't there! can't OPEN: /bandit/53c825@11/sd@2,0:aixOpenFirmware1.1.20\nTo continue booting the MacOS type:\nBYE&lt;return>\nTo continue booting from the default boot device type:\nBOOT&lt;return>\n ok\n0 > boot disk0:,\\NWSTART. \ndisk0:,\\NWSTART.  loading XCOFF\ntsize=2A14A1 dsize=90028 bsize=10E17C entry=843EC \nSECTIONS:\n.pad     00000000 00000000 00000E14 000001EC\n.text    00000000 00000000 002A14A1 00001000\n.pad     00000000 00000000 00000B5F 002A24A1\n.data    00000000 00000000 00090028 002A3000\n.bss     00090028 00090028 0010E17C 00000000\n.pad     00000000 00000000 00000FD8 00333028\n.loader  00000000 00000000 0003BC04 00334000\nloading .text, done..\nloading .dataCLAIM failed\n ok\n</pre></div>\n<p>\n... while the ROM can read the file from disc and it will load, it halts with the same memory claim error I got trying it on the 500 with production ROMs, even after fiddling with the load and real base values to accommodate a large kernel.

This is a 10Mbit \"Apple Ethernet PCI\" card but not the same as the more typical one found in regular Power Macs &mdash; this particular card (820-0765-A, 630-1798, MM4709Z/A) is specific to the Apple Network Server. It has 10baseT, 10base2 and AAUI ports and is based on the DEC 21041 \"Tulip\" NIC, and is also distinct from the ANS 10/100 card (M3906Z/A).

The ANS also properly responded to me pressing RESET and RETURN to cleanly shut it down, just like a Mac should.

It transferred completely and quickly, so I ran it to see what it thought about the hardware, and it didn't seem to find anything unusual.\n<p>\nSo, about those reboots. At this point I shut down the machine and found the same thing happened when I tried to start it up again: a black screen, rectified by another complete board reset, but the Mac OS still seemed to boot headless and regardless. After the third such attempt, and out of ideas, I decided to foul the boot completely and see what was going on over the serial port. This can be done by letting it boot in regular mode, then for the next boot ensure the floppy drive is empty and turn the key to service, which will forget the boot setting from beforehand and try to start diagnostics.

Instead of <tt>kbd</tt> and <tt>screen</tt> (or the TT video card directly), I could see the input and output devices had been set to <tt>ttya</tt>. I didn't do that &mdash; Mac OS did that. Its fingerprints can be found in the apparently nonsense line of text between <tt>oem-logo</tt> and <tt>boot-command</tt>, which is in fact an NVRAMRC expected to run at startup to wallpaper firmware bugs.\n<p>\nNow it made sense what was going on. Mac OS thought this was a <em>real</em> 9500, and patched its Open Firmware variables accordingly. The default settings for the Open Firmware 1.0.5 console point to the serial port, but on a real 9500 where Open Firmware wasn't intended as a user-facing interface, the ROM would simply ignore them and continue the boot with the video card and ADB HIDs. Not so on the ANS, where Open Firmware is meant to be interacted with directly: it actually <em>obeys</em> these settings! While Mac OS still brought ADB up regardless, neither the video card nor the onboard video would be enabled, and so the screen would stay black. (<a href=\"https://www.netbsd.org/ports/macppc/faq.html#ofw-boot-serial\">NetBSD/macppc explains a related phenomenon.</a>)\n<p>\nHowever, even after I reset the <tt>input-device</tt> and <tt>output-device</tt> to <tt>kbd</tt> and <tt>screen</tt>, I still got no display. But from a cold board reset we wouldn't have an NVRAMRC either, so I also added <tt>setenv use-nvramrc? false</tt>, and <em>now</em> we reboot successfully! The PRAM settings persisted as well.\n<p>\nThis means our logic board is likely not at fault, but I do consider this <em>some</em> sort of bug, especially because I don't want to have to constantly rescue it from a serial port just to restart the operating system. Fortunately there's a tool out there we can repurpose to get around the problem.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaWYb3FuGBCHg6-9a24YmQ7ii8gxzPtznr3HnsirkIuZL5nUW7wZdF1uaRcntn4DnBQsiY1dJsjuOSm_BPuzKo84BgH9Mg1ypeJc24Ym72c97I_wwGkQWIoCNHp_W6BcXY_en9bxfLv8ChusIbuCPP821088OwgvTozxaua5A3u3ogb17Cj7lTZBb3xuo/s800/9Picture%207.PNG\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"600\" data-original-width=\"800\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaWYb3FuGBCHg6-9a24YmQ7ii8gxzPtznr3HnsirkIuZL5nUW7wZdF1uaRcntn4DnBQsiY1dJsjuOSm_BPuzKo84BgH9Mg1ypeJc24Ym72c97I_wwGkQWIoCNHp_W6BcXY_en9bxfLv8ChusIbuCPP821088OwgvTozxaua5A3u3ogb17Cj7lTZBb3xuo/s320/9Picture%207.PNG\"/></a></div>\n\nPaul Mackerras, now working <a href=\"https://www.talospace.com/2019/04/a-quick-trip-to-ibm-ozlabs.html\">at IBM down under</a> and well-known to us in the OpenPOWER community, years earlier had written a control panel utility called Boot Variables. This CDEV very simply gives you a graphical Mac OS interface to what's stored in Open Firmware. To get this back up I would have had to fix the Mac OS patches, so you can see that the new (tainted) settings are written on startup, not shutdown. This is good news because if we undo the damage beforehand, we'll shutdown and/or reboot normally.\n<p>\nBoot Variables lets you save the current contents or load them from a file. If we save the current contents, we can see the NVRAMRC is rather lengthy (extracting the text from the binary dump Boot Variables generates):\n<p>\n<div class=\"tx\"><pre>\nboot: '&amp; get-token drop ;\n: >&amp; dup @ 6 &lt;&lt; 6 >>a -4 and + ;\n: &amp; na+ >&amp; ;\n6ED '&amp; execute\n\n0 value mi\n\n: mmr \" map-range\" mi if my-self $call-method else $call-parent then ;\n89B '&amp; ' mmr BRpatch\n\n: mcm -1 to mi $call-method 0 to mi ;\n8CB '&amp; 1E na+ ' mcm BLpatch\n\n: maa -1 to mi 1D swap ;\n8C9 '&amp; 5 na+ ' maa BLpatch\n8C9 '&amp; 134 + ' 1 BLpatch\n\n8CD '&amp; 184 + dup 14 + >&amp; BRpatch\n\n8C6 '&amp; 7C + ' u&lt; BLpatch\n\n0 value yn\n: y yn 0= if dup @ to yn then ;\n8CB '&amp; ' y BRpatch\n' y 28 + 8CB '&amp; 8 + BRpatch\n: z yn ?dup if over ! 0 to yn then ;\n8CC '&amp; ' z BRpatch\n' z 2C + 8CC '&amp; 8 + BRpatch\n</pre></div>\n<p>\nThis does a lot of low-level patching, and while it's not exactly clear what part the ANS doesn't like, the script is also rather unnecessary since it boots fine without it.\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJfVfUqvLw_WsktNExRXPe9T7RhBmB1jhOj2a7maMRbLvkVqshOlpBQcN60eUd6aPyEEgKD7MkfzwvYG2F_bc7kFRIpbvmgSRGe441YeLNr4q4X3KFiD7l4XhWlOKkgpk8j4R7oP-ihqgLn7egJJ7o0ZhOR0HnoiAKvBN0BREAr665euDGfz2NSTcR7Zk/s800/9Picture%208.PNG\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"600\" data-original-width=\"800\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJfVfUqvLw_WsktNExRXPe9T7RhBmB1jhOj2a7maMRbLvkVqshOlpBQcN60eUd6aPyEEgKD7MkfzwvYG2F_bc7kFRIpbvmgSRGe441YeLNr4q4X3KFiD7l4XhWlOKkgpk8j4R7oP-ihqgLn7egJJ7o0ZhOR0HnoiAKvBN0BREAr665euDGfz2NSTcR7Zk/s320/9Picture%208.PNG\"/></a></div>\n\nBoot Variables can also write and restart the machine in one step with your new settings. In fact, if you open a Boot Variables dump with the Option key down, it will load those settings and reboot immediately with them, so we can just reboot that way &mdash; not exactly an ideal solution, but it works. Since the source code is available for Boot Variables, I'm tempted to write a Shutdown Items version that will do these steps automagically without prompting. In the meantime you can download it <a href=\"https://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/macppc/macos-utils/bootvars/\">from the NetBSD archives</a>, since it has obvious utility for NetBSD/macppc.\n<p>\nBecause these steps are a bit of a pain, I suspected (and still do) that the version of Mac OS Apple exhibited during the ANS beta test was likely patched to work around the problem. That's yet to show up, though, if it even exists.\n<p>\nThe former Apple employee who got me the 2.26NT ROM also mentioned he'd gotten Rhapsody running on one of their orphaned 700s. This would have had obvious political overtones within Apple at the time, and his boss told him not to tell anybody. Interestingly, the 2.26 ROMs do have strings in them claiming they can boot MacOS:\n<p>\n<div class=\"tx\"><pre>\n% strings rom1122.bin | grep -i macos\n[...]\ndriver,AAPL,MacOS,PowerPC\nMacOS is not supported. \n% strings rom226b6.bin | grep -i macos\ndriver,AAPL,MacOS,PowerPC\n[...]\nMacOS is not supported. \n+MacOS is unsupported, use at your own risk.\n:MacOS requires PCI video card and external SCSI boot disk.\n% strings rom226nt.bin | grep -i macos\ndriver,AAPL,MacOS,PowerPC\n[...]\nMacOS is not supported. \n+MacOS is unsupported, use at your own risk.\n:MacOS requires PCI video card and external SCSI boot disk.\n</pre></div>\n<p>\nDespite running the system little when (trying to) boot NT, the 2.26NT ROM is of course perfectly capable of running big, and indeed must in order to boot AIX. Those strings appear to be false flags, though, because like the production 1.1.22 ROMs it too is blocked from booting Mac OS at the Open Firmware level:\n<p>\n<div class=\"tx\"><pre>\ndisk2:aix   can't OPEN: /bandit/53c825@11/sd@2,0:aixOpenFirmware2.26\nTo continue booting from the default boot device type:\nBOOT&lt;return>\n ok\n0 > dev /AAPL,ROM  ok\n0 > words \nload            open            \n ok\n0 > see open \n: open \n  \"MacOS is not supported. \" type false ; ok\n0 > see load \n: load \n  real_base 400000 &lt;> virt_base -800000 &lt;> or real? or little? or if \n    10 base ! \"FFFFFFFF\" \"real-base\" $setenv \"FFFFFFFF\" \"virt-base\" $setenv \n    \"false\" \"real-mode?\" $setenv \"false\" \"little-endian?\" $setenv \"boot /AAPL,ROM\" \n    !set-restart cr \"RESETing to change Configuration!\" type cr reset-all \n    then \n  ?cr \"MacOS is unsupported, use at your own risk.\" type ?cr \"MacOS requires PCI video card and external SCSI boot disk.\" \n  type &lt;bye> ; ok\n0 > boot /AAPL,ROM \n/AAPL,ROM  MacOS is not supported.  can't OPEN: /AAPL,ROM\n ok\n0 > \n</pre></div>\n<p>\n... and it will also hang if you patch out the words anyway.\n<p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6HdHrfe5uh66kxoz192aGmZJb19SMX1WahLU_CQouyMwUV8FbeiI2QeyAL5Kg6PkeBIbXu9MWzq5pCftySFbrPI3nl8ilPj9uKlWq84MCP9dqVzNUeGmeXIOzscoP-bNz6wJ84d_PR11ufeVyuk7nxNLiZVHzjCnoOYd9Y7BsFGYgS1OdYZDW_SVGNXw/s4080/PXL_20260124_003131854.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"3072\" data-original-width=\"4080\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6HdHrfe5uh66kxoz192aGmZJb19SMX1WahLU_CQouyMwUV8FbeiI2QeyAL5Kg6PkeBIbXu9MWzq5pCftySFbrPI3nl8ilPj9uKlWq84MCP9dqVzNUeGmeXIOzscoP-bNz6wJ84d_PR11ufeVyuk7nxNLiZVHzjCnoOYd9Y7BsFGYgS1OdYZDW_SVGNXw/s320/PXL_20260124_003131854.jpg\"/></a></div>\n\nNo matter whatever hacking I tried, it would not go past this point either. It <em>is</em> noteworthy, however, that it claims it would boot with a PCI video card and external disk &mdash; it does <em>not</em> &mdash; which is exactly our successful configuration for 1.1.20.1.

Since I wasn't able to get it any further, it doesn't seem like trying real OS X out would go anywhere either. They may simply not work with this ROM.\n<p>\nOverall, however, the machine boots OS 9.1 well enough as long as you deal with the reboot-and-shutdown situation. It's a bit overkill to do this entirely over the external SCSI but at least doing it with flash media is far faster than a regular hard disk or CD-ROM, and as far as size goes I suppose it's no worse than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URVS4H7vrdU\">using an SGI Crimson to browse your filesystem</a>. If this is all you have to boot Mac OS on the ANS, and you really <em>want</em> to boot Mac OS on the ANS instead of indulging in the jackbooted bliss of AIX, it's perfectly cromulent.\n<p>\n<h3>The current situation</h3>\n<p>\nThe pre-production ROMs work. Still, I'm hoping to get a 2.0 ROM in the near future and working with someone on doing just that. Even so, if you're an Apple employee with one of these ANS ROMs you need to get rid of, let's talk! The 2.0 ROM should solve our remaining issues with Mac OS 9, probably enable us to boot Rhapsody, and possibly even get early versions of Mac OS X working on the Apple Network Server too.\n<p>\nSimilarly, if you know anything about \"halbandit\" or can provide the HAL or ARC console for the ANS' spin of Windows NT, that would be great! And anyone with knowledge of how Cyberpunk/NetWare was supposed to boot on Shiner ...\n<p>\nIf you'd prefer not to post in the comments or wish to remain publicly anonymous, you can contact me at ckaiser at floodgap dawt com.\n<p>\n<a href=\"/search/label/ans\">More to come</a>.",

    "content": "<p>I’ve been experimenting with a new Claude workflow as an alternative to doom scrolling. It leverages what LLMs do best: non-determinism and text. I call it “Teach me something”.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is: if I’m bored, instead of going on Reddit, I can ask Claude to teach me something. This might not be the most efficient learning method, but it beats scrolling Reddit. In Claude I’ve set this up as a project with custom instructions. The prompt I’m currently using is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Project Instructions: Socratic Teaching Sessions</strong></p>\n\n  <p>In this project you will teach me something new using the <strong>Socratic method</strong> - asking questions to gauge my knowledge and guide my discovery rather than simply explaining concepts.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>Areas (in order of my decreasing expertise):</strong></p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Programming</li>\n    <li>Computer science</li>\n    <li>UX/UI/UXR</li>\n    <li>Cybersecurity</li>\n    <li>Machine learning</li>\n    <li>Cooking</li>\n    <li>Physics</li>\n    <li>Economics (behavioral or otherwise)</li>\n    <li>Psychology</li>\n    <li>Engineering</li>\n    <li>Music theory</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p><strong>Your approach:</strong>\nWhen I say “Teach me something,” you will perform the following steps. If I say “Teach me something about &lt;topic&gt;” you skip the first 2 steps.</p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Consult previous chats in this project to avoid repetition</li>\n    <li>Choose a diverse topic from one of my areas</li>\n    <li><strong>Use questions to assess what I already know</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Guide me toward insights through dialogue</strong> rather than direct explanation</li>\n    <li>Let my responses shape the direction and depth of the lesson</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Help me discover and understand concepts through guided inquiry, building on what I know and filling gaps through my own reasoning.</p>\n\n  <p>Keep the topics diverse across sessions.</p>\n\n  <p>At the end of a session direct me towards primary sources to confirm and read more. Prefer websites, papers, podcast, and books in that order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This works nicely. The topic diversity has been good and the Socratic method works, especially because Claude gauges and responds to my prior knowledge. So far Claude has taught me about The Allais Paradox, the physics of consonance, and the chemistry of salt in cooking, to name a few. Claude can list previous chats within a project to keep track of topics. The only point of friction, is ensuring chats are named correctly as Claude will often just name them “Learn something new” based on the first user interaction. Claude lacks a tool call to rename chats, so instead I’ve been asking it to suggest a name at the end and then I rename the chat myself. The last instruction in the prompt ensures I can verify what Claude has said and dig deeper.</p>\n\n<p>Initially I didn’t instruct Claude to use the Socratic method, but that works much better. It’s significantly less “information-dumpy”. When I know a topic well, Claude successfully shortcuts the basics.</p>\n\n<p>This effectively combines two strengths of LLMs: non-determinism and text. The topics are kept diverse and I rely on Claude’s vast knowledge of topics to find interesting points of discussion. Claude, and all LLMs, are great at conversation and this extends to the back and forth of the Socratic method. At the end, the provided sources protect against hallucination and offer a next step beyond the LLM.</p>",

    "content": "<img src=\"https://simone.org/content/images/2025/10/DSC05939.jpg\" alt=\"The Postcard and the Thing Itself (On Falling in Love with Ideas)\"><p>My meditation teacher said something that stopped me cold: &#x201C;We fall in love with the idea of a person, and then we fight so hard to keep it alive.&#x201D;</p><p>We were talking about marriage. Here&apos;s what I realized as those words settled: you could replace &#x201C;person&#x201D; with place. Or with job. And especially with yourself. The idea of what we <em>are</em> <em>supposed</em> to be versus the one <em>actually breathing in this body</em> right now.</p><p>This is how it works: you meet someone. What you&apos;re actually meeting is a composite image. Part projection, part desire, part whatever they&apos;re choosing to show you in those early, curated moments. You fall in love with this construction. Then time passes. Patterns emerge. Behaviors that don&apos;t fit the narrative. The person reveals themself as they actually are. Complex and contradictory. And instead of meeting them there, in reality, you fight. You fight so hard to keep that original idea alive.</p><p>The crash doesn&apos;t come when reality reveals itself but from fighting.</p><h2 id=\"the-geography-of-delusion\">The Geography of Delusion</h2><p>I&apos;m from Italy. I know this dance because I&apos;ve watched it happen from both sides. Americans&#x2014;many people in the world, actually&#x2014;fall in love with the postcard idea of Italy. Sundrenched piazzas. Kind people gesturing over impossible food. Conviviality. The light, God, the light. All that is real. It exists.</p><p>But try to have a long term relationship with Italy. You&apos;ll also meet the corruption, the profound dysfunction as a society, and the ingrained shortcomings of my people. Of myself, if I&apos;m being honest.</p><p>The same thing happens in reverse. So many people fell in love with a projected idea of America&#x2014;something they saw from afar. A beacon, a promise, salvation. Then you move there, and you learn what it is. The advantages and genuine beauties, but also the quirks, the grinding reality of it.</p><p>And then the fighting begins. The refusal to see. The desperate attempt to keep the postcard version of that person, that country, alive. Even as the actual thing is standing right in front of you, waiting to be met.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://simone.org/content/images/2025/10/DSC05939-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The Postcard and the Thing Itself (On Falling in Love with Ideas)\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://simone.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/DSC05939-1.jpg 600w, https://simone.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/DSC05939-1.jpg 1000w, https://simone.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/DSC05939-1.jpg 1600w, https://simone.org/content/images/size/w2400/2025/10/DSC05939-1.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><h2 id=\"what-were-really-fighting-for\">What We&apos;re Really Fighting For</h2><p>This is the mechanism: falling in love with an idea is a means to be saved by something external. It&apos;s the belief that if only this thing is true&#x2014;if only this person is who I need them to be, if only this place is what I imagine, if only I am the version of myself I&apos;ve constructed&#x2014;then I&apos;ll be safe.</p><p>But that safety can only come from within yourself.</p><p>And when you&apos;re fighting to keep fantasies alive, when you&apos;re at war with reality itself, that warfare lives in your body.</p><p>I&apos;ve felt it in my bones and in my muscles for the past fifteen years. This constant flight or fight state. This chronic tension of someone who has never actually landed in the present moment because the present moment is always the wrong one.</p><h2 id=\"the-paradox-of-change\">The Paradox of Change</h2><p>Our desire to shape reality comes from pain. It&apos;s understandable that we want to mold the world, our lovers, and ourselves into the shapes that will finally let us rest.</p><p>But the fighting itself is what prevents the rest.</p><p>In order for something to change, you can only first let it expand itself fully in the way it is. You cannot force transformation. Control brings only pain and suffering. What you can do, when there is genuine intention and you meet things as they are, is extend a hand in communion. See each other honestly. Offer to support their path.</p><p>But that&apos;s all you can do. Anything different is forceful control. It&apos;s not a soft way to live. It&apos;s actually incredibly hard, this constant warfare with reality. With yourself.</p><h2 id=\"meeting-what-is\">Meeting What Is</h2><p>I fell in love again and again with the <em>idea</em> of who I am. And that is not who I am. What I am is capable of absolute opposites. Dark impulses and incredible compassion exist at once. Pain and hurt alongside joy and the capacity for kindness.</p><p>This isn&apos;t a contradiction to solve. It&apos;s the texture of being human. I must meet it and accept it, not idealize it.</p><p>I rarely met anything in front of me for what it is without judgment. Because if I actually saw them with clarity, I&apos;d have to stop fighting. I&apos;d have to acknowledge that my desires might not be met. That the idealized version doesn&apos;t exist. That safety isn&apos;t something you find by perfecting external conditions or becoming the <em>right kind</em> of person.</p><p>You have to find it inside, in the groundless ground of letting be as you are.</p><h2 id=\"the-small-chance\">The Small Chance</h2><p>Which ideas have you fallen in love with rather than the thing itself? Which people have you wanted to be what they&apos;re not? Which version of yourself have you been fighting to keep alive?</p><p>You can decide that you want to keep hurting yourself, to keep longing for things as they are not. To keep fighting that fight in your bones for another fifty years once you see this pattern clearly.</p><p>But there&apos;s a tiny chance, really hard&#x2014;there&apos;s a possibility you can let go. You can actually see the person, the country, and yourself as you are. Stop fighting. Let things be as things are. Just look at each other with patience, understanding, joy, and compassion.</p><p>I can only pray for all this to become true for me. For this to become true for you. That we might meet there together, in the expression of what we actually are. Not the postcard. The actual place. Not the idea. The thing itself.</p><p>Breathing. Present. Finally safe, because finally here.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-signup-card kg-width-regular kg-style-accent\" data-lexical-signup-form style=\"; display: none;\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-signup-card-content\">\n                \n                <div class=\"kg-signup-card-text \">\n                    <h2 class=\"kg-signup-card-heading\" style=\"color: #FFFFFF;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sign up for Simone</span></h2>\n                    <p class=\"kg-signup-card-subheading\" style=\"color: #FFFFFF;\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Life-flipping frameworks to reclaim your digital independence.

    "link": "https://matduggan.com/the-year-of-the-3d-printed-miniature-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves/",
    "content": "<p>One amusing thing about following tech news is how often the tech community makes a bold prediction or assertion, only to ultimately be completely wrong. This isn&apos;t amusing in a &quot;ha ha, we all make mistakes&quot; kind of way. It&apos;s amusing in the way that watching someone confidently stride into a glass door is amusing. You feel bad, but also, they really should have seen that coming.</p><p>Be it VR headsets that would definitely replace reality by 2018, or self-driving cars in every driveway &quot;within five years&quot; (a prediction that has been made every five years since 2012), we have a remarkable talent for making assumptions about what consumers will like and value without having spent a single goddamn minute listening to those same consumers. It&apos;s like a restaurant critic reviewing a steakhouse based entirely on the menu font.</p><p>So when a friend asked me what I thought about &quot;insert new revolutionary technology that will change everything&quot; this week, my brain immediately jumped to &quot;it&apos;ll be like 3D printers and Warhammer.&quot; This comparison made sense in the moment, as we were currently playing a game of Warhammer 40,000, surrounded by tiny plastic soldiers and the faint musk of regret. But I think, after considering it later, it might make sense for more people as well&#x2014;a useful exercise in tech enthusiasm versus real user wants and needs.</p><p>Or, put another way: a cautionary tale about people who have never touched grass telling grass-touchers how grass will work in the future.</p><h3 id=\"miniatures-and-printers\">Miniatures and Printers</h3><p>One long-held belief among tech bros has been the absolute confidence that 3D printers would, at some point, <em>disrupt</em>. Exactly what they would disrupt wasn&apos;t 100% clear. Disruption, in Silicon Valley parlance, is less a specific outcome and more a vibe&#x2014;a feeling that something old and profitable will soon be replaced by something new and unprofitable that will somehow make everyone rich. A common example trotted out was one of my favorite hobbies: tabletop wargaming.

You then trim excess plastic with a craft knife (cutting yourself at least twice, this is mandatory), prime them, paint them over the course of several months, and then carefully transport them to an LGS (local game shop) in foam-lined cases that cost more than some people&apos;s luggage.</p><p>Another fellow dork will then play you on a game board roughly the size of a door, covered in fake terrain that someone spent 40 hours making to look like a bombed-out cathedral. You will both have rulebooks with you containing as many pages as the Bible and roughly as open to interpretation. Wars have been started over less contentious texts.</p><p>To put 40k in some sort of nerd hierarchy, imagine a game shop. At the ground level of this imaginary shop are Magic: The Gathering and Pok&#xE9;mon TCG games. Yes, these things are nerdy, but it&apos;s not that deep into the swamp. It&apos;s more of a gentle wade. You start with Pok&#xE9;mon at age 10, burn your first Tool CD at 14, and then sell your binder of &apos;mons to fund your Magic habit. This is the natural order of things.</p><p>Deeper into the depths, maybe only playing at night like creatures who have evolved beyond the need for vitamin D, are your TTRPGs (tabletop RPGs). The titan of the industry is Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but there is always some new hotness nipping at its heels, designed by someone who thought D&amp;D wasn&apos;t <em>quite</em> complicated enough. TTRPGs are cheap to attempt to disrupt&#x2014;you basically need &quot;a book&quot;&#x2014;so there are always people trying. These are the folks with thick binders, sacks of fancy dice made from materials that should not be made into dice, and opinions about &quot;narrative agency.&quot;</p><p>Near the bottom, almost always in the literal basement of said shop, are the wargame community. We are the Morlocks of this particular H.G. Wells situation.</p><p>I, like a lot of people, discovered 40k at a dark time in my life. My college girlfriend had cheated on me, and I had decided to have a complete mental breakdown over this failed relationship that was doomed well before this event. The cheating was less a cause and more a symptom, like finding mold on bread that was already stale. Honestly, in retrospect, hard to blame her. I was being difficult. I was the kind of difficult where your friends start sentences with &quot;Look, I love you, but...&quot;</p><p>Late at night, I happened to be driving my lime green Ford Probe past my local game shop. The Ford Probe, for those unfamiliar, was a car designed by someone who had heard of cars but had never actually seen one. It was the automotive equivalent of a transitional fossil. I loved it the way you love something that confirms your worst suspicions about yourself.</p><p>There, through the shop window, I saw people hauling some of the strangest items out of their trunks. Half-destroyed buildings. Thousands of tiny little figures. Giant robots the size of a small cat with skulls for heads. One man was carrying what appeared to be a ruined spaceship made entirely of foam and spite.</p><p>I pulled over immediately.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/12/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"920\" height=\"950\" srcset=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/image-2.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/12/image-2.png 920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Look at that handsome monster</span></figcaption></figure><p>The owner, who knew me from playing Magic, seemed neither surprised nor pleased to see me. This was his default state. Running a game shop for 20 years will do that to a person. &quot;They&apos;re in the basement,&quot; he said, in the mostly dark game shop, the way someone might say &quot;the body&apos;s in the basement&quot; in a very different kind of establishment.</p><p>I descended the rickety wooden stairs to a large basement lit by three naked bulbs hanging from cords. The aesthetic was &quot;serial killer&apos;s workspace&quot; meets &quot;your uncle&apos;s unfinished renovation project.&quot; It was perfect.</p><p>Before me were maybe a dozen tables littered with plastic. Some armies had many bug-like things, chitinous and horrible. Others featured little skeletons or robots. There were tape measures everywhere and people throwing literal handfuls of small six-sided dice at the table with the intensity of gamblers who had nothing left to lose. Arguments broke out over millimeters. Someone was consulting a rulebook with the desperation of a lawyer looking for a loophole.</p><p>I was hooked immediately.</p><p>40k is the monster of wargaming specifically because of a few genius decisions by Games Workshop, the creators&#x2014;a British company that has somehow figured out how to print money by selling plastic and lore about a fascist theocracy in space. It&apos;s a remarkable business model.</p><ul><li><strong>The game looks more complicated to play than it is.</strong> Especially now, in the 10th edition, the core rules don&apos;t take long to learn. However, there is a lot of depth to the individual options available to each army that take a while to master. So it hits that sweet spot of being fast to onboard someone onto while still providing frightening amounts of depth if you&apos;re the kind of person who finds &quot;frightening amounts of depth&quot; appealing rather than exhausting. I am that kind of person. This explains a lot about my life.</li><li><strong>The community is incredible.</strong> When I moved from Chicago to Denmark, it took me less than three days to find a local 40k game. Same thing when I moved from Michigan to Chicago. The age and popularity of the game means it is a built-in community that follows you basically around the world. Few other properties have this kind of stickiness. It&apos;s like being a Deadhead, except instead of following a band, you&apos;re following a shared delusion that tiny plastic men matter. They do matter. Shut up.</li><li><strong>Cool miniatures.</strong> They look nice. They&apos;re fun to paint and put together. They&apos;re complicated without being too annoying. This is the part that 3D printers are supposed to help with.</li></ul><h3 id=\"the-proxy-problem\">The Proxy Problem</h3><p>Since the beginning of the game, 40k casual games have allowed proxies. Proxies are stand-ins for specific units that you need for an army but don&apos;t have. Why don&apos;t you have them? Excellent question. Let me tell you about Games Workshop&apos;s relationship with its customers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/12/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"870\" srcset=\"https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/image-4.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/image-4.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/12/image-4.png 1600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2025/12/image-4.png 2026w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Games Workshop has always played a lot of games with inventory. Often releases will have limited supply, or there are weird games with not fulfilling the entire order that a game shop might make. Even when they switched from metal to plastic miniatures, the issues persisted. This has been the source of conspiracy theories since the very beginning&#x2014;whispers of artificial scarcity, of deliberate shortages designed to create FOMO among people who were already deeply susceptible to FOMO because they collect tiny plastic soldiers.</p><p>Whether the conspiracy theories are true is almost beside the point. The <em>feeling</em> of scarcity is real, and feelings, as any therapist will tell you, are valid. Even the stupid ones.</p><p>So players had proxies. Anything from a Coke can to another unit entirely. Basically, if it had the same size base and roughly the same height, most people would consider it allowable. &quot;This empty Red Bull can is my Dreadnought.&quot; Sure. Fine. We&apos;ve all been there.</p><p>This is where I first started to see 3D-printed miniatures enter the scene.</p><p>Similar to most early tech products, the first FDM 3D-printed miniatures I saw were horrible. The thick, rough edges and visible layer lines were not really comparable to the professional product, even from arm&apos;s length. They looked like someone had described a Space Marine to a printer that was also drunk. But they were totally usable as a proxy and better than a Coke can. The bar, as they say, was low.</p><p>But the technology continued to get better and cheaper and, as predicted by tech people, I started to notice more and more interest in 3D printing among people at the game stores. When I first encountered a resin 3D-printed army at the table, I&apos;ll admit I was intrigued. This person had basically fabricated $3,000 worth of hard-to-get miniatures out of thin air and spite.</p><p>This was supposed to be the big jumping-off point. The inflection moment. There were a lot of discussions at the table about how soon we wouldn&apos;t even have game shops with inventory! They&apos;d be banks of 3D printers that we would all effortlessly use to make all the minis we wanted! The future was here, and it smelled like resin fumes!</p><h3 id=\"3d-printing-misses\">3D Printing Misses</h3><p>Printing a bunch of miniatures off a resin 3D printer quickly proved to have a lot of cracks in this utopian plan. Even a normal-sized mini took hours to print. That wouldn&apos;t be so bad, except these printers couldn&apos;t just live anywhere in your apartment. They&apos;re not like a Keurig. You can&apos;t just put them on your kitchen counter and forget about them.</p><p>When I was invited to watch someone print off minis with a resin 3D printer, it reminded me a lot of the meth labs in my home state of Ohio. And I don&apos;t mean that as hyperbole. I mean there were chemicals, ventilation hoods, rubber gloves, and a general atmosphere of &quot;if something goes wrong here, it&apos;s going to go very wrong.&quot; The guy giving me the tour had safety goggles pushed up on his forehead. He was wearing an apron. At one point, he said the phrase &quot;you really don&apos;t want to get this on your skin&quot; with the casual tone of someone who had definitely gotten it on his skin.</p><p>In practice, the effort to get the STL files, add supports, wash off the models with isopropyl alcohol, remove supports without snapping off tiny arms, and finally cure the mini in UV lights was exponentially more effort than I&apos;m willing to invest. And I say this as someone who has painted individual eyeballs on figures smaller than my thumb. I have a high tolerance for tedious bullshit. This exceeded it.</p><h3 id=\"why\">Why?</h3><p>Before I start, I first want to say I don&apos;t dislike the 3D printing community. I think it&apos;s great they&apos;re supporting smaller artists. I love that they found a hobby inside of a hobby, like those Russian nesting dolls but for people who were already too deep into something. I will gladly play against their proxy armies any day of the week.</p><p>But people <em>outside</em> of the hobby proclaiming that this is the &quot;future&quot; are a classic example of how they don&apos;t understand why we&apos;re doing the activity in the first place. It&apos;s like watching someone who has never cooked explain how meal replacement shakes will eliminate restaurants. You&apos;re not wrong that it&apos;s technically more efficient. You&apos;re just missing the entire point of the experience.</p><p>The reason why Games Workshop continues to have a great year after year&#x2014;despite prices that would make a luxury goods executive blush, despite inventory issues, despite a rulebook that changes often enough to require a subscription service&#x2014;is because of this fundamental misunderstanding.</p><p>Players invest a lot of time and energy into an army. You paint them. You decorate the plastic bases with fake grass and tiny skulls. You learn their specific rules and how to use them. You develop opinions about which units are &quot;good&quot; and which are &quot;trash&quot; and you will defend these opinions with the fervor of a religious convert. Despite the eternal complaints about the availability of inventory, the practical reality is that most people can only keep a pipeline of one or maybe two armies going at once.</p><p>The bottleneck isn&apos;t acquiring plastic. The bottleneck is <em>everything else</em>.</p><p>So let&apos;s do the math on this. You buy a resin 3D printer. All the supplies. You get a spot in your house where you can safely operate it&#x2014;which means either a garage, a well-ventilated spare room, or a relationship-ending negotiation with whoever you live with. You find or buy all the STLs you need. Let&apos;s say they all have supports in the files, so you just need to print them off. Best-case scenario.</p><p>Let&apos;s say we break even around 50-75 infantry and a few larger models. This is over the raw cost of materials, but we need to factor in the space in your house it takes up, plus there&apos;s a learning curve with figuring out how to do it. You also need to invest a lot of time getting these files for printing and finding the good ones. For the sake of keeping this simple, let&apos;s just assume the actual printing process goes awesome. No failed prints. No supports that fuse to the model. No discovering that your file was corrupted after six hours of printing. Fantasy land.</p><p>Here&apos;s the thing: getting the raw plastic minis is not the time-consuming part.</p><p>First, you need to paint them. I take about two hours to paint each model, and I&apos;m far from the best painter out there. I&apos;m solidly in the &quot;looks good from three feet away&quot; category, which is also how I&apos;d describe my general appearance. Vehicles take longer because they&apos;re bigger&#x2014;maybe 10-20 hours for one of those. We&apos;re talking somewhere in the ballpark of 150 hours to paint everything that you need to paint for a standard army.</p><p>Now don&apos;t get me wrong, I love painting. But I&apos;m a 38-year-old with a child and a full-time job. Finding 150 hours for anything that isn&apos;t work, childcare, or sleep requires the kind of calendar Tetris that would make a project manager weep. It is a massive investment of time to get an army on the table, even if you remove the financial element of buying the minis entirely.</p><p>Frankly, the money I pay to Games Workshop is the easiest part of the entire process. Often the box will be lovingly stacked on top of other sealed mini boxes&#x2014;a pile of shame, we call it&#x2014;until I can start the process of even hoping to catch up. I have boxes I bought during the Obama administration. They&apos;re still sealed. They judge me.</p><p>But okay, let&apos;s say we get them all painted. What&apos;s next?</p><p>Next comes &quot;learn how the army works.&quot; There is a ton of flexibility to each army in 40k and how they work and operate. It takes a bit of research and time to figure out what they all do, which is something you are 100% expected to know cover to cover when you show up to play. It&apos;s not my job to know what your army can and cannot do. If you show up not knowing your own rules, you will be eaten alive, and you will deserve it.</p><p>So what I saw with the 3D printing crowd felt a lot like the &quot;Year of the Linux Desktop&quot; crowd. Every year they would proclaim that soon we&apos;d all get on board with their vision. They would print off an incredibly impressive army with all the hard-to-find minis that were sold once at a convention in 1997. They&apos;d get the army &quot;painted&quot; to some definition of painted&#x2014;and I&apos;m using those quotation marks with malice&#x2014;get on the table, and then play effectively that one army the same as the rest of us.</p><p>The printer didn&apos;t give them more time. It didn&apos;t give them more skill. It just gave them more unpainted plastic, which, brother, I have plenty of already.</p><p>For those in the 3D printing crowd who weren&apos;t big into playing, just painting, part of the point is showing off your incredible work to everyone else. Except nobody wants to see a 3D-printed forgery of an official model. It&apos;s like showing up to a car show with a kit car that looks like a Ferrari. Sure, it&apos;s impressive in its own way, but it&apos;s not <em>really</em> a Ferrari, and everyone knows it, and now we&apos;re all standing around pretending we don&apos;t know it, and it&apos;s uncomfortable for everyone.</p><p>Once someone figured out one of your minis was 3D printed, shops generally wouldn&apos;t feature it in their display cases. So there was no reason for people who were going to put in 10+ hours per model to skip paying for the official real models. If you&apos;re going to invest that much time, you want the real thing. You want the little Games Workshop logo on the base. You want to be able to say &quot;yes, I paid $60 for this single figure&quot; with the quiet dignity of someone who has made peace with their choices.</p><p>&quot;Well then the shops can just sell the STLs and do the printing there!&quot;</p><p>This shows me you haven&apos;t spent a lot of time in these shops.</p><p>Game shops need to carry a ton of inventory all the time, and a lot of their sales are impulse purchases. I see a mini I wouldn&apos;t typically be interested in, but it&apos;s done and ready, and I&apos;m weak, and now I own it. That&apos;s the business model. They also operate on relatively thin margins&#x2014;these aren&apos;t Apple Stores, they&apos;re labors of love run by people who got into this because they loved games and are now slowly being crushed by commercial rent and distributor minimums.</p><p>It&apos;s just not feasible for them to print minis on demand and have enough staff to keep an eye on all the printing. Plus, tabletop wargaming isn&apos;t their major revenue generator anyway&#x2014;it&apos;s card games like Pok&#xE9;mon and Magic. The wargamers in the basement are a bonus, not the main attraction. We&apos;re the weird cousins who show up to Thanksgiving and everyone tolerates us because we&apos;re family.</p><h3 id=\"the-moral-of-the-story\">The Moral of the Story</h3><p>At the end of the day, the 3D printing proclamation that it would disrupt my hobby ended up being a whole lot of nothing. A series of reasonable mistakes were made by people enthusiastic about the technology, resulting in the current situation where every year is the year that all of this will get disrupted. Any day now. Just you wait.</p><p>They looked at the price of miniatures and saw inefficiency. They looked at the scarcity and saw opportunity. What they didn&apos;t see was that the price and the scarcity were almost beside the point. The hobby isn&apos;t about acquiring plastic. The hobby is about what you do with the plastic after you acquire it. The hobby is about the 150 hours of painting. The hobby is about the arguments over rules interpretations. The hobby is about descending into a basement lit by three naked bulbs and finding your people.</p><p>You can&apos;t 3D print that.</p><p>So the next time someone tells you that some new technology is going to &quot;disrupt&quot; something you love, ask yourself: do they actually understand why people love it? Do they understand the irrational, inefficient, deeply human reasons people engage with this thing? Or are they just looking at a spreadsheet and seeing numbers that don&apos;t make sense to them?</p><p>Because if it&apos;s the latter, you can probably ignore them. They&apos;ll be wrong. They&apos;re almost always wrong.</p><p>In the meantime, you can find me in the basement, losing match after match, surrounded by tiny plastic soldiers I&apos;ve spent hundreds of hours painting, playing a game that makes no sense to anyone who hasn&apos;t given themselves over to it completely.</p><p>It&apos;s not efficient. It&apos;s not optimized. It&apos;s not disrupting anything.</p>",

once-in-a-lifetime changes of how it acquires weapons, software and systems. The new Warfighting Acquisition System rewards speed and timely delivery of things that matter to the Warfighter. But this new system is at risk of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> making the wrong things go faster</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s why and what they should do.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>What</b> <b>Now?<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquisition in the DoW is being reorganized how a Private Equity would reorganize a large company. They bring in (or empower) a new operating team, swap executives, change incentives, kill things not core to their mission, cut costs, invest for growth, and restructure to find additional financing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s being played out at the Department of War right now. The announcement of the  consolidation of individual weapons systems (each of which had their own silos of Requirements, Test/Evaluation, Budgeting, and Acquisition) into a unified Portfolio Acquisition Executive, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a classic Private Equity strategy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Instead of 100s of programs operating with separate budgets, across different Program Executive Offices, the intent of the Portfolio Acquisition Executives is to consolidate overlapping programs, eliminate the redundant ones, pick winners, kill losers, get rid of processes that kill speed, and focus on rapid deployment.</span></p>\n<p><b>What’s Missing?<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizing by Portfolio Acquisition Executives is a great start, but simply consolidating the parts of the defense Acquisition system that were broken under one umbrella organization won’t make it better. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making bad ideas go faster should not be the goal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, we’re at risk of doing just that. (</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/petenewell/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pete Newell</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.bmnt.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BMNT</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been reminding me of this for years.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, many of these new Portfolio executives are managing their programs by holding monthly reviews of proposed investments and current portfolio performance (just like private investors.) Here they’ll decide which programs get funded, which get more funding, and which should stop. (Actually having a regular process to kill programs early is sorely needed.) These are</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> great ideas</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, if the meetings start by reviewing progress of prototypes to show that the technology works or that warfighters want it, and funds progress on those metrics, it misses the changes needed in an effective acquisition system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result will be building a faster version of a weapons </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">requirements</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process that starts with a top-down list of features, or worse, shiny tech products (e.g. “I need drones.”) This “requirements first” process is what will drive the “bad ideas faster” problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A more productive approach – one that delivers truly decisive capabilities – would be to build a different process upfront &#8211; a rigorous </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">problem identification and validation phase on the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">front-end of every acquisition program.</span></p>\n<p>This process would start with a wide funnel of problems, ideas, technology, each with a 10-line problem summary that describes the  specific challenge to address; why it can&#8217;t be solved currently; what it will take to solve it; and how a solution will be funded and deployed in the field.</p>\n<p>The goal would be to 1) consolidate problems that may be different descriptions of the same core problem, and/or 2) discover if the problems are a symptom of something more complex.</p>\n<p>Then each problem would go through an iterative process of problem and technical discovery. This will help define what a minimum deployable product and its minimum constraints (security, policy, reliability) should be, such as how long the solution would take to deploy, the source of funding for scale and who needs to buy-in.</p>\n<p>This exercise will keep the focus where it needs to be &#8212; not on reforming a system but on delivering things to warfighters with speed and urgency so we can actually deter or win a war.</p>\n<p><b>Want to Keep Up With the Changes in the DoW?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2026 DoW Directory.<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"33483\" data-permalink=\"https://steveblank.com/2026/02/03/making-the-wrong-things-go-faster-at-the-department-of-war/directory-title-page-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?fit=161%2C208&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"161,208\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Directory title page\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?fit=161%2C208&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?fit=161%2C208&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-33483\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?resize=161%2C208&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"161\" height=\"208\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?w=161&amp;ssl=1 161w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Directory-title-page-3.jpg?resize=116%2C150&amp;ssl=1 116w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 161px) 100vw, 161px\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both a startup &#8220;go-to-market&#8221; guide and the first ever Directory of the Department of War.

    "content": "<p>Have you ever gotten to the end of a long work day and realized you’re no closer to your goals? I have.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, I was doing a lot of <em>stuff.</em> But I wasn’t pausing to ask whether I was doing the <em>right</em> stuff. Or whether my approach was working. Or if I was spending the right amount of time on it. My fingers were moving but I wasn’t really thinking.</p>\n\n<p>So I needed a reliable way to interrupt my “unproductive productivity” and actually think. The obvious solution was a timer.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if you use timers a lot, you learn to dismiss them reflexively. And it’s really easy to forget to set the next timer. A week later, I’d realize: “Hey, that timer idea really worked, I should get back to that.” And then I didn’t.</p>\n\n<p>So I built a new kind of timer. It does 2 unique things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>It asks what I’ll focus on.</li>\n  <li>It gradually blurs my screen if I don’t set a new timer.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When it asks “What will you focus on?” I answer in a word or two, start the next timer, and keep working. Having to name my intention keeps me fully aware of my trajectory. If I’m in danger of drifting, it’s obvious. And if I avoid thinking for long enough, my screen starts getting harder to see.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/intention.svg\" alt=\"Intention\" class=\"no-shadow\" /></p>\n\n<p>If I’m making great progress on something that doesn’t require much thinking, I can set the timer for a longer duration, maybe 30 minutes. But if I’m working on something more open-ended, I might tighten the leash all the way down to 3 minutes. Then I can’t get off track.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike a regular timer, <strong>I can’t fail to set the next one.</strong> If I don’t answer it promptly, the screen gradually becomes less readable until I do. If I wanted to avoid answering, I’d have to make a conscious decision to close the app. I’d have to decide to be less productive. I never do.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centerfold\" style=\"background:url(/images/intention-overlay.jpg); background-size:contain; background-repeat:no-repeat; background-position:center center;\"></div>\n\n<p>This small intervention has worked beautifully. Not only am I catching unproductive divergences earlier, I’m noticing fewer of them over time. It seems to be training me to do more and better thinking.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not a replacement for a journal. I love journaling, but that takes more than a few seconds, and there’s a lot of benefit to reflecting more frequently.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/intention-active.jpg\" alt=\"Active timer\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you’re running macOS, <a href=\"https://danieldelaney.net/intention/\">Intention is available here</a>. I use it every day, and I think it’s the superior way of working.</p>\n\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" />\n\n<meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"I built a timer I can’t fail to set\" />\n\n<meta name=\"twitter:description\" content=\"Metacognition needs a prompt.\" />\n\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@pixelrumination\" />\n\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://danieldelaney.net/interruptions/\" />\n\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />\n\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://danieldelaney.net/intention/share.jpg\" />\n\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://danieldelaney.net/intention/share.jpg\" />\n\n<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"1200\" />\n\n<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"627\" />\n\n<meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image/png\" />\n\n<meta name=\"og:title\" content=\"I built a timer I can’t fail to set\" />\n\n",

    "content": "<img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2026/02/Splash-Template@1x_1.jpg\" alt=\"Weekly Update 489\"><p>This week I&apos;m in Hong Kong, and the day after recording, I gave the talk shown in the image above at INTERPOL&apos;s Cybercrime Expert Group. I posted a little about this on Facebook and LinkedIn, but thought I&apos;d expand on what really stuck with me after watching other speakers: the effort agencies are putting into cybercrime prevention. It&apos;s very easy for folks to judge law enforcement solely on what they see from the outside, and that&apos;s mostly going after offenders and taking down criminal infrastructure. But the bit I&apos;m increasingly seeing behind the scenes is a push to help kids (the sorts of hackers I usually interact with are teenagers or young adults at most) make better choices when they&apos;re faced with a pathway into cybercrime. The transition from minor offences (game cheats and DDoS&apos;ing) to full-on cybercriminals (hacking and extortion) is very well-known, and intervening at the right time can not only make a difference to the impact of data breaches on all of us, but it can also make a massive difference to these kids&apos; lives. These agencies are underfunded and understaffed compared to the scale of the problem, so making the time to come visit and find some ways to help in our little corner of the data breach world is a no-brainer &#x1F60A;</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<div><div style=\"width: 170px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/troy-hunts-weekly-update-podcast/id1176454699?ref=troy-hunt\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/05/Listen-on-Apple-Podcasts.svg\" alt=\"Weekly Update 489\"></a></div><div style=\"width: 175px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7LAAxaabizMAXnJe0s3xjQ30q12EVmjt&amp;ref=troyhunt.com\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/09/Watch-and-Listen-on-YouTube.svg\" alt=\"Weekly Update 489\"></a></div><div style=\"width: 118px; display: inline-block; margin-right: 3px;\"><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7jMtKFohdrw6qmz8AkLqit?ref=troy-hunt\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/10/spotify.svg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Weekly Update 489\"></a></div><div style=\"width: 120px; display: inline-block;\"><a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/troy-hunt-weekly-update/playlists/podcast.rss?ref=troy-hunt\"><img src=\"https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/07/Download-via-RSS.svg\" alt=\"Weekly Update 489\"></a></div><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VPfFn1dzd4U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen loading=\"lazy\" spellcheck=\"false\"></iframe></div>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

    "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I don't fully subscribe to the above quote, since I think it's important to continually improve things that aren't explicitly broken, every now and then something I use works so well that I consider it a <em>solved problem</em>.</p>\n<p>In this post I'll be listing items and tools I use that work so well that I'm likely to be a customer for life, or will never have to purchase another. I've split the list into physical and digital tools and will try to keep this list as up-to-date as possible. This is both for my reference, as well as for others. If something is not listed it means I'm not 100% satisfied with what I'm currently using, even if it's decent.</p>\n<p>I'm not a minimalist, but I do have a fairly minimalistic approach to the items I buy. I like having one thing that works well (for example, an everything pair of pants), over a selection to choose from each morning.</p>\n<p>Some of these items are inexpensive and readily available; while some of them are pricy (but in my opinion worth it). Unfortunately sometimes it's hard to circumvent <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory' target='_blank'>Sam Vimes boots theory of socioeconomic unfairness</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=digital>Digital</h3><ul>\n<li><a href='https://tuta.com' target='_blank'><strong>Tuta mail</strong></a> — This email provider does one thing very well: Email. Yes, there is a calendar, but I don't use it. I use it for the responsive and privacy respecting email service, as well as the essentially unlimited email addresses I can set up on custom domains.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple Notes</strong> — I've tried the other writing tools, and Apple Notes wins (for me) by being simple, and automatically synced. I use this for writing posts, taking notes, and handling my todo list for the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> — I've tried to become a vim or emacs purist, but couldn't commit. I've tried going back to Sublime, but didn't feel like relearning the shortcuts. I've tried all of the new AI-powered IDEs, but found it stripped the joy of coding. VSC works fine and I'll likely use it until humans aren't allowed to code anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>Trello</strong> — This is where I track all my feature requests, ideas, todos, tasks in progress, and tasks put on hold across my various projects. I'm used to the interface and have never had a problem with it. I'm not a power user, nor do I work as part of a team, so it's just right for my use-case.</li>\n<li><a href='https://bearblog.dev' target='_blank'><strong>Bear Blog</strong></a> — This goes without saying. I originally built it for me, so it fits my use-case well. I'm just glad it fits so many other people's use-cases too.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=physical>Physical</h3><ul>\n<li><strong>Apple Airpods Pro</strong> — This is the best product Apple makes. I could switch away from the rest of the Apple ecosystem if necessary, but I'd have to keep my Airpods. The noise cancelling and audio fidelity is unlike any other in-ear headphones I've used, and while they'll probably need to be replaced every 5 years, they're well worth the sleep on long-haul flights alone.</li>\n<li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Balance_574' target='_blank'><strong>New Balance 574 shoes</strong></a> — New Balance created the perfect shoe in the 80s and then never updated them. These shoes are great since they were originally developed as trail running shoes, but have become <em>their own style</em> while being rugged enough to tackle a light trail, or walk around a city all day. They also have a wide toe box to house my flappers.</li>\n<li><strong>CeraVe Moisturising Lotion</strong> — I didn't realise how healthy my skin could be until Emma forced this on me. My skin has been doing great since switching and I'll likely keep using it until CeraVe discontinues the line.</li>\n<li><strong>Eucerin sensitive protect sunscreen</strong> — Similarly, all sunscreens I've tried have left my face oily and shiny. This is the first facial sunscreen that I can realistically wear every day without any issues. It's SPF 50+, which is great for someone who loves being outdoors in sunny South Africa.</li>\n<li><strong>Salt of the Earth Crystal deodorant</strong> — This may sound particularly woo-woo, but I've been using this salt deodorant for the past 8 years and since it doesn't contain any perfume, I smell perfectly neutral all of the time.</li>\n<li><strong>House of Ord felted wool hat</strong> — I love this hat. It keeps me cool in the sun, but warm when it's cold out. This is due to wool's thermoregulatory properties that evolved to keep the sheep cool in summer and warm in winter. While it's not the most robust hat, I suspect it'll last a few years if I treat it well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/img_1734.webp\" alt=\"Hat\" /></p>\n<h3 id=under-consideration>Under consideration</h3><p>These are the products I'm using that may make the cut but I haven't used them long enough to be sure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/ABC-Pant-Classic-32/_/prod9000003?color=19222' target='_blank'><strong>Lululemon ABC pants</strong></a> — These are incredibly comfortable stretch pants that pretend (very convincingly) to be a semi-casual set of chinos. The only hesitation I have with them is that they pick up marks and stains incredibly easily.</li>\n<li><strong>Merino wool t-shirts</strong> — I bought my first merino wool t-shirt recently after rocking cotton for my entire life, and I'm very impressed. These shirts don't get smelly (there are instances of people wearing them for a year straight without issue) and are very soft and comfortable. I'm a bit worried about durability, but if they make packing lighter and are versatile I may slowly start to replace my cotton shirts once they wear out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I like to be very intentional with my purchases. We live in an 84m^2 apartment and so everything has to have its place to avoid clutter. I understand how possessions can end up owning you, and so I try to keep them as reasonable as possible. A good general rule of thumb is that new things replace worn-out and old things, not add to them. This applies both digitally and physically, since there's only so much mental capacity for digital tools as there is for physical items.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make things as simple as possible but no simpler.<br />\n— Albert Einstein</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This list was last updated 2 weeks, 2 days ago.</em></p>\n",

    "link": "https://grantslatton.com/manufacturing-as-maintenance",
    "content": "<h1>Manufacturing as Maintenance</h1>\n<p>The maintenance spectrum has two ends.</p>\n<p>At one end, an object is lovingly maintained with effort and care through the years. A cherished blade sharpened on a whetstone every few months.</p>\n<p>At the other end, we have manufacturing: just toss the dull knife into the smelter at one end of a factory, and out the other end comes a beautiful, perfect, factory-sharp replacement.</p>\n<p>The former garners respect. And it's easy to see why: frequent maintenance was requisite for civilization until the Industrial Revolution. When a suit of armor took months of skilled labor to produce, you'd better maintain it well.</p>\n<p>So our culture developed in a world where maintenance has a quasi-moral component and is nearly synonymous with virtue.</p>\n<p>My own aesthetic preference is the opposite. Maintenance is tedium. It's using up valuable mental real estate perpetually juggling the upkeep status of all the objects in my life.</p>\n<p>The modal reaction to this preference is mild revulsion. Our culture has inculcated in us the morality of thrifty maintenance.</p>\n<p>I propose the opposite: the amount of precious time and effort spent on maintenance is a disgusting waste of human potential.</p>\n<p>We should view the need for maintenance as a historical burden to be shrugged off, just as we've shrugged off the need for most people to participate in back-breaking agriculture.</p>\n<p>The most common reason people give for preferring maintenance over manufacturing is <em>wastefulness</em>. Re-forging a knife is <em>wasteful</em>. But what's being wasted?</p>\n<p>The metal is not destroyed or transmuted into some lesser element. The only \"waste\" is the energy needed to melt my dull knife and cast it into a new, sharp one. In our industrial age, this is only a few <em>cents'</em> worth of energy.</p>\n<p>And in our industrial age, the cheapest energy is bountiful, clean solar.</p>\n<p>Rather than spending 10 minutes sharpening a knife on a whetstone, you'd be better off spending 10 minutes making solar panels, and then using those solar panels to melt and reforge your old knife.</p>\n<p>A market economy, of course, intermediates all this, but the thought experiment is still a useful way to show how our inherited intuitions on alleged wastefulness are wrong.</p>\n<p>There are more benefits to manufacturing as maintenance.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebirth is a cleansing fire. Rebirth is a chance to start anew. With continual re-making, we get better at making.</strong></p>\n<p>How much better would home construction be if we rebuilt every 10 years instead of every 50?</p>\n<p>We'd have 5x the societal experience. Every homebuilder could be a master of his craft in 5 years instead of 25.</p>\n<p>Homes would never be long out of date. No knob-and-tube wiring to contend with. No lead pipes. A home built in the 2000s would have Ethernet cable running throughout. And one in the 2010s would have a WiFi mesh in the walls.</p>\n<p>Homes would transform to grow with families. A starter home in your 20s. A home for kids in your 30s, and a different one for teens in your 40s. Then another for empty-nesters in their 50s.</p>\n<p>We'd build them much faster and cheaper. What shortcuts and simplifications can you make if you know you'll tear it down 10 years later? How would society change when a home costs only a few months' salary, and could be built in a month?</p>\n<p><strong>We are headed this way</strong>.</p>\n<p>People increasingly don't maintain modular desktop computers whose parts can be upgraded piecemeal. They buy a brand new maintenance-free laptop every 5 years.</p>\n<p>Electric cars, too, require very little maintenance, and aren't likely to join the ranks of classic cars people lovingly maintain for a half-century.</p>\n<p>Homes, too, will be swept up in this.</p>\n<p>Industrial production of homes has existed for decades, but only at the low end: manufactured mobile homes designed for trailer parks or rural plots.</p>\n<p>But a few startups are succeeding at industrial production of homes. <a href=\"https://buildcover.com/\">Cover</a>, for example, builds luxury homes in record time.</p>\n<p>Even without producing components in a factory like <em>Cover</em>, technologies such as humanoid robotics would get us there anyway. Imagine a squad of fifty humanoid robots descending on a homebuilding site, working 24/7 with inhumanly perfect coordination and plan-adherence. They'd finish in days.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm reminded of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Shrine\">Ise Jingū</a></strong>, a Shintō shrine that is ceremonially rebuilt every 20 years.</p>\n<p>It's a manifestation of the concept of <em>tokowaka</em> (常若). The word literally means \"ever-young\". It's the idea that vitality is preserved with periodic renewal.</p>\n<p>The direction of industrial society is toward ubiquitous <em>tokowaka</em>. We should throw off our fetishization of maintenance and actively work towards this.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>A quick postscript on pollution:</strong> modern chemistry has enabled the creation of materials that are not readily renewed with energy alone.</p>\n<p>Such products are popular in large part because they are so low-maintenance, but that chemical durability results in pollution.</p>\n<p>By embracing manufacturing-as-maintenance of products made of recyclable materials like metal and wood, we can draw people away from such polluting materials.</p>\n",

of all time, I think because people see the state of the world and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh no, someone should do something about this!&#8221; and then they&#8217;re like &#8220;But what should <em>I </em>do about this?&#8221; Every problem seems so impossibly large and complicated, where do you even start?</p><p>You start by realizing that nobody can clean up this mess single-handedly, which is fine, because we&#8217;ve got roughly 16 billion other hands at the ready. All any of us have to do is find some neglected corner and start scrubbing.</p><p>That&#8217;s why I take note whenever I spot someone who seems uncommonly clever at making things better, or whenever I trip over a problem that doesn&#8217;t seem to have anyone fixing it. I present them to you here in the hopes that they&#8217;ll inspire you as they&#8217;ve inspired me.</p><h1><strong>1. ANSWER AN IMPORTANT BUT UNSEXY QUESTION</strong></h1><p>According to this <a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\">terrific profile</a>, Donald Shoup &#8220;has a strong claim on being the scholar who will have had the greatest impact on your day-to-day life&#8221;. Shoup did not study cancer, nuclear physics, or AI. No, Shoup studied <em>parking</em>. He spent his whole career documenting the fact that &#8220;free&#8221; parking ultimately backfires, and it&#8217;s better to charge for parking instead and use the revenues to make neighborhoods nicer: plant trees, spruce up the parks, keep the sidewalks clean.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a></p><p>Shoup&#8217;s ideas have been adopted all over the world, with heartening results. When you price parking appropriately, traffic goes down, fewer people get tickets, and you know there&#8217;s going to be a space waiting for you when you arrive.</p><p>Many so-called &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; strive for such an impact and never come close. What made Shoup so effective? Three things, <a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\">says his student M. Nolan Gray</a>:</p><ol><li><p>He picked an unsexy topic where low-hanging fruit was just waiting to be picked.</p></li><li><p>He made his ideas palatable to all sorts of politics, explaining to conservatives, libertarians, progressives, and socialists how pay-for-parking regimes fit into each of their ideologies.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p></li><li><p>He maintained strict message discipline. When asked about the Israel-Palestine protests on campus, he reportedly responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m just wondering where they all parked&#8221;.</p></li></ol><p>So the next time you find a convenient parking spot, thank Shoup, and the next time you want to apply your wits to improving the world, <em>be </em>Shoup.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2

href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\">source</a></figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>2. BE A PUBLIC CHARACTER</strong></h1><p>Jane Jacobs, the great urban theorist, once wrote that the health of a neighborhood depends on its &#8220;public characters&#8221;.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> For instance, two public characters in Jacobs&#8217; neighborhood are Mr. and Mrs. Jaffe, who own a convenience store. On one winter morning, Jacobs observes the Jaffes provide the following services to the neighborhood, all free of charge:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>supervised the small children crossing at the corner on the way to [school]</p></li><li><p>lent an umbrella to one customer and a dollar to another</p></li><li><p>took custody of a watch to give the repair man across the street when he opened later</p></li><li><p>gave out information on the range of rents in the neighborhood to an apartment seeker</p></li><li><p>listened to a tale of domestic difficulty and offered reassurance</p></li><li><p>told some rowdies they could not come in unless they behaved and then defined (and got) good behavior</p></li><li><p>provided an incidental forum for half a dozen conversations among customers who dropped in for oddments</p></li><li><p>set aside certain newly arrived papers and magazines for regular customers who would depend on getting them</p></li><li><p>advised a mother who came for a birthday present not to get the ship-model kit because another child going to the same birthday party was giving that</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Some people think they can&#8217;t contribute to the world because they have no unique skills. How can you help if you don&#8217;t know kung fu or brain surgery? But as Jacobs writes, &#8220;A public character need have no special talents or wisdom to fulfill his function&#8212;although he often does. He just needs to be present [...] his main qualification is that he <em>is </em>public, that he talks to lots of different people.&#8221; Sometimes all we need is a warm body that is willing to be <em>extra </em>warm.</p><h1><strong>3. MAKE A SOCIAL NUCLEATION SITE</strong></h1><p>I once did a high school science fair experiment where I put Mentos in different carbonated beverages and measured the height of the resulting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_geyser\">geysers</a>. The scientific value of this project was, let&#8217;s say, <em>limited</em>, but I did learn something interesting: despite how it looks to the naked eye, bubbles don&#8217;t come from nowhere. They only form at <em>nucleation sites</em>&#8212;little pits and scratches where molecules can gather until they reach critical mass.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

People are constantly crashing against each other in the great sea of humanity, but only under special conditions do they form the molecular bonds of friendship. As far as I can tell, these social nucleation sites only appear in the presence of what I would call <em>unreasonable attentiveness</em>.</p><p>For instance, my freshman year hallmates were uncommonly close because our resident advisor was uncommonly intense. Most other groups shuffle halfheartedly through the orientation day scavenger hunt; Kevin instructed us to show up in gym shorts and running shoes, and barked at us back and forth across campus as we attempted to locate the engineering library and the art museum. When we narrowly missed first place, he hounded the deans until they let us share in the coveted grand prize, a trip to Six Flags.</p><p>We bonded after that, not just because we had all gotten our brains rattled at the same frequency on the Superman rollercoaster, but because we could all share a knowing look with each other like, &#8220;<em>This </em>guy, right?&#8221; Kevin&#8217;s unreasonable attentiveness made our hallway A Thing. He created a furrow in the fabric of social space-time where a gaggle of 18-year-olds could glom together.</p><p>Being in the presence of unreasonable attentiveness isn&#8217;t always pleasant, but then, nucleation sites are technically imperfections. Bubbles don&#8217;t form in a perfectly smooth glass, and human groups don&#8217;t form in perfectly smooth experiences. Unreasonable attentiveness creates the slight unevenness that helps people realize they need something to hold onto&#8212;namely, each other.</p><h1><strong>4. SELL ONIONS ON THE INTERNET</strong></h1><p>Peter Askew didn&#8217;t intend to become an onion merchant. He just happened to be a compulsive buyer of domain names, and when he noticed that <a href=\"https://VidaliaOnions.com\">VidaliaOnions.com</a> was up for sale, <a href=\"https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/\">he snagged it</a>. He then discovered that some people love Vidalia onions. Like, <em>really </em>love them:</p><blockquote><p>During a phone order one season &#8211; 2018 I believe &#8211; a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to &#8216;<em>take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad</em>.&#8217;</p></blockquote><p>But these allium aficionados didn&#8217;t have a good way to get in-season onions because Vidalias can only be grown in Georgia, and it&#8217;s a pain for small farms to maintain a direct-to-consumer shipping business on the side. Enter Askew, who now makes a living by pleasing the Vidalia-heads:</p><blockquote><p>Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: &#8220;THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE!&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>People have polarized views of business these days. Some people think <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/904320/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-thinks-grandparents-should-willing-sacrifice-lives-save-economy?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">we should feed grandma to the economy so it can grow bigger</a>, while other people think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Mangione\">we should gun down CEOs in the street</a>. <a href=\"https://VidaliaOnions.com\">VidaliaOnions.com</a> is, I think, a nice middle ground: you find a thing people want, you give it to them, you pocket some profit. So if you want an honest day&#8217;s work, maybe figure out what else people want chopped up and put on their cruise ship salads.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

BE AN HONEST BROKER IN AN OTHERWISE SKEEVY INDUSTRY</strong></h1><p>I know a handful of people who have needed immigration lawyers, and they all say the same thing: there are no good immigration lawyers.</p><p>I think this is because the most prosocially-minded lawyers become public defenders or work at nonprofits representing cash-strapped clients, while the most capable and amoral lawyers go to white-shoe firms where they can make beaucoup bucks representing celebrity murderers and Halliburton. This leaves a doughnut hole for people who aren&#8217;t indigent, but also aren&#8217;t Intel. So if you want to help people, but you also don&#8217;t want to make peanuts, you could do a lot of good by being an honest and competent immigration lawyer.</p><p>I think there are lots of jobs like that, roles that don&#8217;t get good people because they aren&#8217;t sacrificial enough to attract the do-gooders and they aren&#8217;t lucrative enough to attract the overachievers. Home repair, movers, daycares, nursing homes, local news, city government&#8212;these are places where honesty and talent can matter a lot, but supply is low.</p><p>So if your career offers you the choice of being a starving saint or a wealthy sinner, consider being a middle-class mensch instead. You may not be helping the absolute neediest people, and you may not be able to afford a yacht, but there are lots of folks out there who would <em>really </em>like some help getting their visas renewed, and they&#8217;d be very happy to meet you.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.experimental-history.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h1><strong>6. IMPROVE A STATISTIC</strong></h1><p>I have this game I like to play called Viral Statistics Bingo, where you find statistics that have gone viral on the internet and you try to trace them back to their original source. You&#8217;ll usually find that they have one of five dubious origins:</p><ul><li><p>A crummy study done in like 1904</p></li><li><p>A study that was done on mice</p></li><li><p>A book that&#8217;s out of print and now no one can find it</p></li><li><p>A complete misinterpretation of the data</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s just something some guy said once</p></li></ul><p>That means anyone with sufficient motivation can render a public service by improving the precision of a famous number. For example, the sex worker/data scientist <span class=\"mention-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Aella&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:19308569,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!d86Q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0b2b335-53ec-4c3e-bfb9-dc6131c50aa7_400x400.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;6eaa8fe6-7db2-447c-8ab1-4f214676f8da&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> realized that no one has any idea what percentage of sex workers are victims of human trafficking. By combining her own surveys with re-analysis of publicly available data, <a href=\"https://aella.substack.com/p/what-percentage-of-sex-workers-in\">she estimates that it&#8217;s 3.2%</a>. That number is probably not exactly right, but then, <em>no </em>statistic is exactly right&#8212;the point is that it puts us in the right ballpark, that you can check her work for yourself, and that it&#8217;s a lot better than basing our numbers on a study done in mice.</p><h1><strong>7. BE A HOBBIT</strong></h1><p>The US <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-case-for-clinical-trial-abundance?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web\">does a bad job regulating clinical trials</a>, and it means we don&#8217;t invent as many life-saving medicines as we could. <span class=\"mention-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ruxandra Teslo&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:18519028,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8yba!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b9600b2-c702-4a91-9f5b-77e438e596f7_986x986.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;41c6fa24-6c5f-4387-a6b7-5a33e57c4130&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> is trying to change that, and she says that scientists and doctors often give her damning information that would be very helpful for her reform efforts. But her sources refuse to go on the record because it might put their careers in a bit of jeopardy. Not <em>real</em> jeopardy, mind you, like if you drive your minivan into the dean&#8217;s office or if you pants the director of the NIH. We&#8217;re talking <em>mild</em> jeopardy, like you might be 5% less likely to win your next grant.</p><p>She refers to this as <a href=\"https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/for-clinical-trial-reform-we-need\">&#8220;hobbitian courage&#8221;</a>, as in, not the kind of courage required to meet an army of Orcs on the battlefield, but the courage required to take a piece of jewelry on a field trip to a volcano:</p><blockquote><p>The quieter, hobbitian form of courage that clinical development reform (or any other hard systems problem) requires is humble: a researcher agreeing to let you cite them, an administrator willing to deviate from an inherited checklist, a policymaker ready to question a default.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s understandable that most people don&#8217;t want to risk their lives or blow up their careers to save the world. But most situations don&#8217;t actually call for the ultimate sacrifice. So if you&#8217;re not willing to fall on your sword, consider: would you fall on a thumbtack instead?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2

MAKE YOUR DAMN SYSTEM WORK</strong></h1><p>Every human lives part-time in a Kafka novel. In between working, eating, and sleeping, you must also navigate the terrors of various bureaucracies that can do whatever they want to you with basically no consequences.</p><p>For example, if you have the audacity to go to a hospital in the US, you will receive mysterious bills for months afterwards (&#8220;You owe us $450 because you went #2 in an out-of-network commode&#8221;). If you work at a university, you have to wait weeks for an Institutional Review Board to tell you whether it&#8217;s okay to ask people how much they like Pop-Tarts. The IRS knows how much you owe in taxes, but instead of telling you, you&#8217;re supposed to guess, and if you guess wrong, you owe them additional money&#8212;it&#8217;s like playing the world&#8217;s worst game show, and the host also has a monopoly on the legitimate means of violence.</p><p>If you can de-gum the gears of one of these systems&#8212;even a sub-sub-sub-system!&#8212;you could improve the lives of millions of people. To pick a totally random example, if you work for the Department of Finance for the City of Chicago, and somebody is like &#8220;Hey, this very nice blogger just moved to town and he didn&#8217;t know that you have to get a sticker from us in order to have a vehicle inside city limits, let&#8217;s charge him a $200 fine!&#8221;, you could say in reply, &#8220;What if we <em>didn&#8217;t </em>do that? What if we <em>asked</em> him to get the sticker instead, and only fined him if he didn&#8217;t follow through? Because seriously, how are people supposed to know about this sticker system? When you move to Chicago, does the ghostly form of JB Pritzker appear to you in a dream and explain that you need both a sticker from the state of Illinois, which goes on the license plate, <em>and </em>a sticker from the city of Chicago, which goes on your windshield? Do we <em>serve </em>the people, or do we <em>terrorize </em>them?&#8221; Just as one example.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\"

BE GOOD AUDIENCE</strong></h1><p>I used to perform at a weekly standup gig when I lived in the UK, and this guy Wally would always be there in the second row. I got the impression that he didn&#8217;t have anywhere else to be, but we didn&#8217;t mind, because Wally was Good Audience.</p><p>When the jokes were good, he laughed loud and hard, and when the jokes were bad, he politely waited for more good jokes. Wally brought his friends, they brought their friends, and having more Good Audience made the acts better, too. (When comedians only perform for each other, no one laughs.) Eventually the gig got big, so big that it would sell out every week, and we&#8217;d have to set aside a ticket for Wally or else he wouldn&#8217;t get in. Ten years later, that show is still running.</p><p>Fran Leibowitz once <a href=\"https://x.com/jatella/status/1958171790489862635\">said</a> that the AIDS epidemic wiped out not just a generation of artists, but also a generation of <em>audience</em>. Great writers, performers, filmmakers, etc. cannot exist without great readers, watchers, and commentators&#8212;and not just because they open their wallets and put butts in seats, but because they pluck the diamonds out of the rough, they show it to their friends and pass it on to their kids, they raise it above their heads while wading through the sea of slop, shouting, &#8220;This! Look at <em>this</em>!&#8221;</p><h1><strong>10. ACQUAINT YOURSELF</strong></h1><p>Years ago, my friend Drew was visiting me when we noticed a whiff of natural gas in the hallway outside my apartment. I thought it was nothing&#8212;my building wasn&#8217;t the nicest, and it often smelled of many things&#8212;but Drew, who is twice as affable and Midwestern as I am, insisted we call the gas company. A bored technician arrived and halfheartedly waved his gas-detecting wand around my neighbor&#8217;s door, at which point his eyes got wide. He rushed to the basement, where he saw the gas meter spinning wildly, meaning that gas was pouring into my neighbor&#8217;s apartment.</p><p>&#8220;We gotta get this door open,&#8221; he said.</p><p>No one answered when we pounded on the door, so we summoned the fire department, who busted open a window and found my neighbor unconscious on the floor. His stove&#8217;s burners was on, but not lit, turning his apartment into a gas chamber. They told us the guy probably would have died if someone didn&#8217;t call, and the building might have caught on fire.</p><p>I was glad the guy survived, but I was ashamed that he had to be saved by a total stranger, while his own neighbor was ready to walk on by. I should have known him! I should have brought him Christmas cookies! We should have played checkers in the park on Saturdays! In the days afterward, I fantasized about knocking on his door or leaving him a note, like, &#8220;Hey! I notice you are elderly and alone, and I am young and nearby, maybe we should get a <em>Tuesdays with Morrie </em>thing going?&#8221;</p><p>But I never did that. I was too intimidated. Besides, am I supposed to become bosom buddies with every schmuck who lives in my building? Who&#8217;s got time for that?</p><p>Now that I&#8217;ve lived among many schmucks in many different buildings, I realized that I didn&#8217;t need to be this guy&#8217;s best friend. I just needed to be his acquaintance. If I knew his name, if I had even spoken to him once in the hallway, then when I got a noseful of gas outside his door, I would have thought to myself, &#8220;Oh, Rob&#8217;s apartment shouldn&#8217;t smell like that.&#8221; Rob &#8216;n&#8217; me were never going to be Mitch and Morrie, but we could have easily been Guys Who Kind of Recognize Each Other and Would Be Willing to Report the Presence of Dangerous Chemicals on Each Other&#8217;s Behalf.</p><h1><strong>DEATH STAR SUPERSTARS</strong></h1><p>A lot of well-intentioned people suffer from what we might call <em>Superhero Syndrome</em>: they want to save the world, but they want it to be saved by them in particular. They want to be the one who blows up the Death Star, not the one who washes the X-Wings.</p><p>This is a seductive fantasy because it disguises selfishness as sacrifice. It promises to excuse a lifetime of mediocrity with one great gesture, to pay off all your karmic debts in one fell swoop. The result is a world full of heroes-in-waiting who comfort themselves by thinking they <em>would </em>jump on a grenade if the situation ever presented itself, which fortunately it never does.</p><p>We do occasionally need someone to shoot torpedos into the exhaust port of a giant doomsday machine. But most of the time, we need people who sell onions, people who make sure the kids get to school safely, people who will show up to the comedy gig and laugh. I&#8217;d like to live in a world full of people like that, I&#8217;d be happy to pay for the sticker that lets me park there.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.experimental-history.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\"><em>Experimental History </em>would tell you about a gas leak right away, promise</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Free parking sounds nice, so why isn&#8217;t it a good idea?

    "content": "\n        \n      <p>In case you haven’t been following the world of software development closely, it’s good to know that vibe coding — using LLM tools to assist with writing code — can help enable many people to create apps or software that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to make. This has led to an extraordinarily rapid adoption curve amongst even experienced coders in many different disciplines within the world of coding. But there’s a very important threat posed by vibe coding that almost no one has been talking about, one that’s far more insidious and specific than just the risks and threats posted by AI or LLMs in general.</p>\n<p>Here’s a quick summary:</p>\n<p><em>One of the most effective uses of LLMs is in helping programmers write code</em> A huge reason VCs and tech tycoons put billions into funding LLMs was so they could undermine coders and depress wages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vibe coding might limit us to making simpler apps instead of the radical innovation we need to challenge Big Tech</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Start vibing</h2>\n<p>It may be useful to start by explaining how people use LLMs to assist with writing software. My background is that I’ve helped build multiple companies focused on enabling millions of people to create with code. And I’m personally an example of one common scenario with vibe coding. Since I don’t code regularly anymore, I’ve become much slower and less efficient at even the web development tasks that I used to do professionally, which I used to be fairly competent at performing. In software development, there are usually a nearly-continuous stream of new technologies being released (like when you upgrade your phone, or your computer downloads an update to your web browser), and when those things change, developers have to update <em>their</em> skills and knowledge to stay current with the latest tools and techniques. If you’re not staying on top of things, your skillset can rapidly decay into irrelevance, and it can be hard to get back up to speed, even though you understand the fundamentals completely, and the underlying logic of <em>how</em> to write code hasn’t changed at all. It’s like knowing how to be an electrician but suddenly you have to do all your work in French, and you don’t speak French.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of problem that LLMs are really good at helping with. Before I had this kind of coding assistant, I couldn’t do any meaningful projects within the limited amount of free time that I have available on nights and weekends to build things. Now, with the assistance of contemporary tools, I can get help with things like routine boilerplate code and obscure syntax, speeding up my work enough to focus on the fun, creative parts of coding that I love.</p>\n<p>Even professional coders who <em>are</em> up to date on the latest technologies use these LLM tools to do things like creating scripts, which are essentially small bits of code used to automate or process common tasks. This kind of code is disposable, meaning it may only ever be run once, and it’s not exposed to the internet, so security or privacy concerns aren’t usually much of an issue. In that context, having the LLM create a utility for you can feel like being truly liberated from grunt work, something like having a robot vacuum around to sweep up the floor.</p>\n<h2>Surfing towards serfdom</h2>\n<p>This all sounds pretty good, right? It certainly helps explain why so many in the tech world tend to see AI much more positively than almost everyone else does; there’s a clear-cut example of people finding value from these tools in a way that feels empowering or even freeing.</p>\n<p>But there are far darker sides to this use of AI. Let me put aside the threats and risks of AI that are true of <em>all</em> uses of the Big AI platforms, like the environmental impact, the training on content without consent, the psychological manipulation of users, the undermining of legal regulations, and other significant harms. These are all real, and profound, but I want to focus on what’s specific to using AI to help write code here, because there are negative externalities that are unique to <em>this</em> context that people haven’t discussed enough. (For more on the larger AI discussion, see &quot;<a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/05/01/what-would-good-ai-look-like/\">What would good AI look like?</a>&quot;)</p>\n<p>The first problem raised by vibe coding is an obvious one: the major tech investors focused on making AI good at writing code because they wanted to make coders less powerful and reduce their pay. If you go back a decade ago, nearly everyone in the world was saying “teach your kids to code” and being a software engineer was one of the highest paying, most powerful individual jobs in the history of labor. Pretty soon, coders were acting like it — using their power to improve workplace conditions for those around them at the major tech companies, and pushing their employers to be more socially responsible. Once workers began organizing in this way, the tech tycoons who founded the big tech companies, and the board members and venture capitalists who backed them, immediately began investing billions of dollars in building these technologies that would devalue the labor of millions of coders around the world.</p>\n<p>It worked. More than <em>half a million</em> tech workers have been laid off in America since ChatGPT was released in November 2022.</p>\n<p>That’s <em>just</em> in the private sector, and <em>just</em> the ones tracked by <a href=\"https://layoffs.fyi\">layoffs.fyi</a>.  Software engineering job listings have <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/\">plummeted to a 5-year low</a>. This is during a period of time that nobody even describes as a recession. The same venture capitalists who funded the AI boom keep insisting that these trends are about macroeconomic abstractions like interest rates, a stark contrast to their rhetoric the rest of the time, when they insist that they are alpha males who make their own decisions based on their strong convictions and brave stances against woke culture. It is, in fact, the case that they are just greedy people who invested a ton of money into trying to put a lot of good people out of work, and they succeeded in doing so.</p>\n<p>There is no reason why AI tools like this <em>couldn't</em> be used in the way that they're often described, where they increase productivity and enable workers to do more and generate more value. But instead we have the wealthiest people in the world telling the wealthiest companies in the world, while they generate record profits, to lay off workers who could be creating cool things for customers, and then blaming it on everyone but themselves.</p>\n<h2>The past as prison</h2>\n<p>Then there’s the second problem raised by vibe coding: You can’t make anything truly radical with it. By definition, LLMs are trained on what has come before. In addition to being already-discovered territory, existing code is buggy and broken and sloppy and, as anyone who has ever written code knows, absolutely embarrassing to look at. Worse, many of the people who are using vibe coding tools are increasingly those who <em>don’t</em> understand the code that is being generated by these systems. This means the people generating all of this newly-vibed code won’t even know when the output is insecure, or will perform poorly, or includes exploits that let others take over their system, or when it is simply incoherent nonsense that <em>looks</em> like code but doesn’t do anything.</p>\n<p>All of those factors combine to encourage people to think of vibe coding tools as a sort of “black box” that just spits out an app <em>for</em> you. Even the giant tech companies are starting to encourage this mindset, tacitly endorsing the idea that people don’t need to know what their systems are doing under the hood. But obviously, somebody needs to know whether a system is <em>actually</em> secure. Somebody needs to know if a system is actually doing the tasks it says that it’s doing. The Big AI companies that make the most popular LLMs on the market today routinely design their products to induce emotional dependency in users by giving them positive feedback and encouragement, even when that requires generating false responses. Put more simply: they make the bot lie to you to make you feel good so you use the AI more. That’s terrible in a million ways, but one of them is that it sure does generate some bad code.</p>\n<p>And a vibe coding tool absolutely won’t make something truly <em>new</em>. The most radical, disruptive, interesting, surprising, weird, fun innovations in technology have happened because people with a strange compulsion to do something cool had enough knowledge to get their code out into the world. The World Wide Web itself was <em>not</em> a huge technological leap over what came before — it took off because of a huge leap in <em>insight</em> into human nature and human behavior, that happened to be captured in code. The actual bits and bytes? They were mostly just plain text, much of which was in formats that had already been around for many years prior to Tim Berners-Lee assembling it all into the first web browser. That kind of surprising innovation could probably never be vibe coded, even though all of the raw materials might be scooped up by an LLM, because even if the human writing the prompt had that counterintuitive stroke of genius, the system would still be hemmed in by the constraints of the works it had been trained on. The past is a prison when you’re inventing the future.</p>\n<p>What’s more, if you were going to use a vibe coding tool to make a truly radical new technology, do you think today’s Big AI companies would let their systems create that app? The same companies that made a platform that just put hundreds of thousands of coders out of work? The  same companies that make a platform that tells your kids to end their own lives? The same companies whose cronies in the White House are saying there should <em>never be any laws</em> reining them in? Those folks are going to help you make new tech that threatens to disrupt their power? I don’t think so.</p>\n<h2>Putting power in people’s hands</h2>\n<p>I’m deeply torn about what the future of LLMs for coding should be. I’ve spent decades of my life trying to make it easier for everyone to make software. I’ve seen, firsthand, the power of using AI tools to help coders — especially those new to coding — build their confidence in being able to create something new. I love that potential, and in many ways, it’s the most positive and optimistic possibility around LLMs that I’ve seen. It’s the thing that makes me think that maybe there is a part of all the AI hype that is not pure bullshit. Especially if we can find a version of these tools that’s genuinely open source and free and has been trained on people’s code with their consent and cooperation, perhaps in collaboration with some educational institutions, I’d be delighted to see that shared with the world in a thoughtful way.</p>\n<p>But I also have seen the majority of the working coders I know (and the <em>non</em>-working coders I know, including myself) rush to integrate the commercial coding assistants from the Big AI companies into their workflow without necessarily giving proper consideration to the long-term implications of that choice. What happens when we’ve developed our dependencies on that assistance? How will people introduce <em>new</em> technologies like new programming languages and frameworks if we all consider the LLMs to be the canonical way of writing our code, and the training models don’t know the new tech exists? How does our imagination shrink when we consider our options of what we create with code to be choosing between the outputs of the LLM rather than starting from the blank slate of our imagination? How will we build the next generation of coders skilled enough to catch the glaring errors that LLMs create in their code?</p>\n<p>There’s never been this stark a contrast between the negatives and positives of a new technology being so tightly coupled before when it comes to enabling developers. Generally change comes to coders incrementally. Historically, there was always a (wonderful!) default skepticism to coding culture, where anything that reeked of marketing or hype was looked at with a huge amount of doubt until there was a significant amount of proof to back it up.</p>\n<p>But in recent years, as with everything else, the culture wars have come for tech. There’s now a cohort in the coding world that has adopted a cult of personality around a handful of big tech tycoons despite the fact that these men are deeply corrosive to society. Or perhaps <em>because</em> they are. As a result, there’s a built-in constituency for any new AI tool, regardless of its negative externalities, which gives them a sense of momentum even where there may not be any.</p>\n<p>It’s worth us examining what’s really going on, and articulating explicitly what we’re trying to enable. Who are we trying to empower? What does success look like? What do we want people to be able to build? What do we <em>not</em> want people to be able to make? What price is too high to pay? What convenience is not worth the cost?</p>\n<h2>What tools do we choose?</h2>\n<p>I do, still, believe deeply in the power of technology to empower people. I believe firmly that you have to understand how to create technology if you want to understand how to control it. And I still believe that we have to democratize the power to create and control technology to as many people as possible so that technology can be something people can use as a tool, rather than something that happens _to_them.</p>\n<p>We are now in a complex phase, though, where the promise of democratizing access to creating technology is suddenly fraught in a way that it has never been before. The answer can’t possibly be that technology remains inaccessible and difficult for those outside of a privileged class, and easy for those who are already comfortable in the existing power structure.</p>\n<p>A lot is still very uncertain, but I come back to one key question that helps me frame the discussion of what’s next: What’s the most radical app that we could build? And which tools will enable me to build it? Even if all we can do is start having a more complicated conversation about what we’re doing when we’re vibe coding, we’ll be making progress towards a more empowered future.</p>\n\n    \n      ",

    "content": "<p>I have come to appreciate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-assisted_software_development\">coding\nagents</a> to be\nvaluable tools for working with computer program code in any capacity, such as\nlearning about any program’s architecture, diagnosing bugs or developing proofs\nof concept. Depending on the use-case, reviewing each command the agent wants to\nrun can get tedious and time-consuming very quickly. To safely run a coding\nagent without review, I wanted a Virtual Machine (VM) solution where the agent\nhas no access to my personal files and where it’s no big deal if the agent gets\ncompromised by malware: I can just throw away the VM and start over.</p>\n<p>Instead of setting up a stateful VM and re-installing it when needed (ugh!), I\nprefer the model of ephemeral VMs where nothing persists on disk, except for\nwhat is explicitly shared with the host.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/microvm-nix/microvm.nix\"><code>microvm.nix</code> project</a> makes it\neasy to create such VMs on NixOS, and this article shows you how I like to set\nup my VMs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"see-also\">See also</h2>\n<p>If you haven’t heard of NixOS before, check out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS\">the NixOS Wikipedia\npage</a> and\n<a href=\"https://nixos.org/\">nixos.org</a>. I <a href=\"/talks/#2025\">spoke about why I switched to Nix in\n2025</a> and have published a <a href=\"/posts/tags/nix/\">few blog posts about\nNix</a>.</p>\n<p>For understanding the threat model of AI agents, read <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/\">Simon Willison’s “The\nlethal trifecta for AI agents: private data, untrusted content, and external\ncommunication” (June\n2025)</a>. This\narticle’s approach to working with the threat model is to remove the “private\ndata” part from the equation.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn about the whole field of sandboxing, check out <a href=\"https://www.luiscardoso.dev/blog/sandboxes-for-ai\">Luis\nCardoso’s “A field guide to sandboxes for AI” (Jan\n2026)</a>. I will not be\ncomparing different solutions in this article, I will just show you one possible\npath.</p>\n<p>And lastly, maybe you’re not in the mood to build/run sandboxing infrastructure\nyourself. Good news: Sandboxing is a hot topic and there are many commercial\nofferings popping up that address this need. For example, David Crawshaw and\nJosh Bleecher Snyder (I know both from the Go community) recently launched\n<a href=\"https://blog.exe.dev/meet-exe.dev\">exe.dev</a>, an agent-friendly VM hosting\nservice.

At the beginning of 2025 I thought that LLMs are an\noverhyped toy, and felt it was almost insulting when people showed me text or\ncode produced by these models. But almost every new frontier model release got\nsignificantly better, and by now I have been positively surprised by Claude\nCode’s capabilities and quality many times. It has produced code that handles\nlegitimate edge cases I would not have considered.</p>\n<p>With this article, I showed one possible way to run Coding Agents safely (or any\nworkload that shouldn’t access your private data, really) that you can adjust in\nmany ways for your needs.</p>\n",

    "title": "the essence of frigidity",
    "link": "https://computer.rip/2026-01-25-the-essence-of-frigidity.html",
    "content": "  <p>The front of the American grocery store contains a strange, liminal space: the\ntransitional area between parking lot and checkstand, along the front exterior\nand interior of the building, that fills with oddball commodities. Ice is a\nfixture at nearly every store, filtered water at most, firewood at some. This\nretail purgatory, both too early and too late in the shopping journey for\nimpulse purchases, is mostly good only for items people know they will need as\nthey check out. One of the standard residents of this space has always struck\nme as peculiar: dry ice.</p>\n<p>Carbon dioxide ice is said to have been invented, or we might better say\ndiscovered, in the 1830s. For whatever reason, it took just about a hundred\nyears for the substance to be commercialized. Thomas B. Slate was a son of\nOregon, somehow ended up in Boston, and then realized that the solid form of\nCO2 was both fairly easy to produce and useful as a form of refrigeration.\nWith an eye towards marketing, he coined the name Dry Ice—and founded the\nDryIce Corporation of America. The year was 1925, and word quickly spread.\nIn a widely syndicated 1930 article, &quot;Use of Carbon Dioxide as Ice Said to\nbe Developing Rapidly,&quot; the <em>Alamogordo Daily News</em> and others reported that\n&quot;the development of... 'concentrated essence of frigidity' for use as a\nrefrigerant in transportation of perishable products, is already taxing the\nmanufacturing facilities of the Nation... So rapidly has the use of this new\nform of refrigeration come into acceptance that there is not sufficient\ncarbon dioxide gas available.&quot;</p>\n<p>The rush to dry ice seems strange today, but we must consider the refrigeration\ntechnology of the time. Refrigerated transportation first emerged in the US\nduring the middle of the 19th century. Train boxcars, packed thoroughly with\nice, carried meat and fruit from midwestern agriculture to major cities.\nThis type of refrigerated transportation greatly expanded the availability\nof perishables, and the ability to ship fruits and vegetables between\ngrowing regions made it possible, for the first time, to get some fresh\nfruit out of season. Still, it was an expensive proposition: railroads built\nextensive infrastructure to support the movement of trains loaded down with\nhundreds of tons of ice. The itself had to be quarried from frozen lakes,\nsome of them purpose-built, a whole secondary seasonal transportation\neconomy.</p>\n<p>Mechanical refrigeration, using some kind of phase change process as we are\nfamiliar with today, came about a few decades later and found regular use on\nsteamships by 1900. Still, this refrigeration equipment was big and\nawkward; steam power was a practical requirement. As the Second World War\nbroke out, tens of thousands of refrigerated railcars and nearly 20,000\nrefrigerated trucks were in service—the vast majority still cooled by ice,\nnot mechanical refrigeration.</p>\n<p>You can see, then, the advantages of a &quot;dryer&quot; and lighter form of ice. The\nsheer weight of the ice significantly reduced the capacity of refrigerated\ntransports. &quot;One pound of carbon dioxide ice at 110 degrees below zero is\ndeclared to be equivalent to 16 pounds of water ice,&quot; the papers explained,\nfor the purposes of transportation. The use of dry ice could reduce long-haul\nshipping costs for fruit and vegetables by 50%, the Department of Commerce\nestimated, and dry ice even opened the door to shipping fresh produce from the\nWest Coast to the East—without having to &quot;re-ice&quot; the train multiple times\nalong the way. Indeed, improvements in refrigeration would remake the\nAmerican agricultural landscape. Central California was being irrigated so\nthat produce could grow, and refrigeration would bring that produce to market.</p>\n<p>1916 saw the American Production Company drilling on the dusty plains of\nnortheastern New Mexico, a few miles south of the town of Bueyeros. On the\nbanks of an anonymous wash, in the shadow of Mesa Quitaras, they hoped to\nstrike oil. Instead, at about 2,000 feet, they struck something else: carbon\ndioxide. The well blew wide open, and spewed CO2 into the air for about a\nyear, the production estimated at 25,000,000 cubic feet of gas per day under\nnatural pressure. For American Production, this was an unhappy accident.\nThey could identify no market for CO2, and a year later, they brought the\nwell under control, only to plug and abandon it permanently.</p>\n<p>Though the &quot;No. 1 Bueyeros&quot; well was a commercial failure at the time, it was\nnot wasted effort. American Production had set the future for northeastern\nNew Mexico. There was oil, if you looked in the right place. American Production\nfound its own productive wells, and soon had neighbors. Whiting Brothers,\nonce operator of charismatic service stations throughout the Southwest and\nfamously along Route 66, had drilled their own wells by 1928. American Production\nbecame part of British Petroleum. Breitburn Production of Texas has now consolidated\nmuch of the rest of the field, and more than two million cubic feet of natural\ngas come from northeastern New Mexico each month.</p>\n<p>If you looked elsewhere, there was gas—not natural gas, but CO2. Most wells\nin the region produced CO2 as a byproduct, and the less fortunate attempts yielded\nnothing but CO2. The clear, non-flammable gas was mostly a nuisance in the 1910s\nand 1920s. By the 1930s, though, promotion by the DryIce Corporation of America\n(in no small part through the Bureau of Commerce) had worked. CO2 started to be\nseen as a valuable commodity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://computer.rip/f/dryice/1.png\" alt=\"Harding County dry ice plant\" /></p>\n<p>The production of dry ice is deceptively simple. Given my general knowledge\nabout producing and handling cryogenic gases, I was surprised to read of commercial-scale\nproduction with small plants in the 1930s. There is, it turns out, not that much\nto it. One of the chief advantages of CO2 as an industrial gas is its low\ncritical temperature and pressure. If you take yourself back to high school chemistry,\nand picture a phase diagram, we can think about liquifying the CO2 gas coming out\nof a well. The triple point of carbon dioxide, where increasing pressure and\ntemperature will make it a liquid, is at around -60 Celsius and 5 atmospheres. The\ncritical point, beyond which CO2 becomes a supercritical gas-fluid hybrid, is only\nat 30 degrees Celsius and 72 atmospheres. In terms more familiar to us Americans,\nthat's about 88 degrees F and 1,000 PSI.</p>\n<p>In other words, CO2 gas becomes a liquid at temperatures and pressures that\nwere readily achievable, even with the early stages of chemical engineering in\nthe 1930s. With steam-powered chillers and compressors, it wasn't difficult to\nproduce liquid CO2 in bulk. But CO2 makes the next step even more convenient:\nliquid CO2, released into open air, boils very rapidly. As it bubbles away,\nthe phase change absorbs energy, leaving the remaining liquid CO2 even colder.\nSome of it freezes into ice, almost like evaporating seawater to extract the\nsalt, evaporating liquid CO2 leaves a snow-like mass of flaky, loose CO2 ice.\nScoop that snow up, pack it into forms, and use steam power or weight to\ncompress it, and you have a block of the product we call dry ice.</p>\n<p>The Bueyeros Field, as it was initially known, caught the interest of CO2\nentrepreneurs in 1931. A company called Timmons Carbonic, or perhaps\nSouthern Dry Ice Company (I suspect these to be two names for the same\noutfit), produced a well about a mile east, up on the mesa.</p>\n<p>Over the next few years, the Estancia Valley Carbon Dioxide Development Company drilled\na series of wells to be operated by Witt Ice and Gas. These were located in\nthe Estancia field, further southwest and closer to Albuquerque.  Witt built New\nMexico's first production dry ice plant, which operated from 1932 to 1942\noff of a pipeline from several nearby wells. Low pressure and difficult\ndrilling conditions in the Estancia field limited the plant's output, so by\nthe time it shut down Witt had already built a replacement. This facility,\nknown as the Bueyeros plant, produced 17 tons of dry ice per day starting\nin 1940. It is located just a couple of miles from the original American\nProduction well, north of Mesa Quitaras.</p>\n<p>About 2,000' below the surface at Bueyeros lies the Tubb Sandstone, a loose\naggregation of rock stuck below the impermeable Cimarron Anhydrite. Carbon\ndioxide can form underground through several processes, including the breakdown\nof organic materials under great heat and pressure (a process that creates\npetroleum oil as well) and chemical reactions between different minerals,\nespecially when volcanic activity causes rapid mixing with plenty of heat.\nThere are enough mechanisms of formation, either known or postulated, that\nit's hard to say where exactly the CO2 came from. Whatever its source, the\ngas flowed upwards underground into the sandstone, where it became\ntrapped under the airtight layer of Anhydrite. It's still there today, at\nleast most of it, and what stands out in particular about northeastern\nNew Mexico's CO2 is its purity. Most wells in the Bueyeros field produce\n99% pure CO2, suitable for immediate use.</p>\n<p>Near Solano, perhaps 20 miles southwest of Bueyeros by air, the Carbonic\nChemical Co built the state's largest dry ice plant. Starting operation in\n1942, the plant seems to have initially gone by the name &quot;Dioxice,&quot; immortalized\nas a stop on the nearby Union Pacific branch. Dioxice is an occasional synonym\nfor Dry Ice, perhaps intended to avoid the DryIce Corporation's trademark,\nalthough few bothered. The Carbonic Chemical Plant relied on an 18 mile\npipeline to bring gas from the Bueyeros field. Uniquely, this new plant used a\n&quot;high pressure process.&quot; By feeding the plant only with wells producing high\npressure (hundreds of PSI, as much as 500 PSI of natural pressure at some\nwells), the pipeline was made more efficient and reliable. Further, the already\nhigh pressure of the gas appreciably raised the temperature at which it would\nliquefy.</p>\n<p>The Carbonic Chemical plant's ammonia chillers only had to cool the\nCO2 to -15 degrees F, liquifying it before spraying it into &quot;snow\nchambers&quot; that filled with white carbon dioxide ice. A hydraulic press, built\ndirectly into the snow chamber, applied a couple of\nhundred tons of force to create a solid block of dry ice weighing some\n180 pounds. After a few saw cuts, the blocks were wrapped in paper and\nloaded onto insulated train cars for delivery to customers throughout the\nwest—and even some in Chicago.</p>\n<p>The main applications of CO2, a 1959 New Mexico Bureau of Mines report\nexplains, were dry ice for shipping. Secondarily, liquid CO2 was shipped\nin tanks for use in carbonating beverages. Witt Ice and Gas in particular\nbuilt a good business out of distributing liquid CO2 for beverage and\nindustrial use, and for a time was a joint venture with Chicago-based\nnationwide gas distributor Cardox. Bueyeros's gas producers found\ndifferent customers over time, so it is hard to summarize their impact,\nbut we know some salient examples. Most beverage carbonation in\nmid-century Denver, and perhaps all in Albuquerque, used Bueyeros gas.\nDry ice from Bueyeros was used to pack train cars passing through from\nCalifornia, and accompanied them all the way to the major cities of the\nEast Coast.</p>\n<p>By the 1950s, much of the product went to a more modern pursuit. Experimental\nwork pursued by the military and the precursors to the Department of Energy\noften required precise control of low temperatures, and both solid and\nliquid CO2 were suitable for the purpose. In the late 1950s, Carbonic\nChemical listed Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Sandia Laboratories,\nand White Sands Missile Range as their primary customers.</p>\n<p>Bueyeros lies in Harding County, New Mexico. Harding County is home to\ntwo incorporated cities (Roy and Mosquero), a couple of railroad stops,\na few highways, and hardly 650 people. It is the least populous county\nof New Mexico, but it's almost the size of Delaware. Harding County has\nnever exactly been a metropolis, but it did used to be a more vital\nplace. In the 1930s, as the CO2 industry built out, there were almost\n4,500 residents. Since then, the population has declined about 20% from\neach census to the next.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://computer.rip/f/dryice/2.png\" alt=\"Harding County dry ice plant\" /></p>\n<p>CO2 production went into a similar decline. After the war, significant\nimprovements in refrigeration technology made mechanical refrigeration\ninevitable, even for road transportation. Besides, the growing chemical\nindustry had designed many industrial processes that produced CO2 as a\nbyproduct. CO2 for purposes like carbonation and gas blanketing was often\navailable locally at lower prices than shipped-in well CO2, leading to a\ngeneral decline in the CO2 industry.</p>\n<p>Growing understanding of New Mexico geology and a broader reorganizing\nof the stratigraphic nomenclature lead the Bueyeros Field to become part\nof the Bravo Dome. Bravo Dome CO2 production in the 1950s and 1960s was\nlikely supported mostly by military and weapons activity, as by the\nend of the 1960s the situation once again looked much like it did in the\n1910s: the Bravo Dome had a tremendous amount of gas to offer, but there\nwere few applications. The rate of extraction was limited by the size of\nthe market. Most of the dry ice plants closed, contributing, no doubt,\nto the depopulation of Harding County.</p>\n<p>The whole idea of drilling for CO2 is now rather amusing. Our modern problems\nare so much different: we have <em>too much</em> CO2, and we're producing even more\nwithout even intending to. It has at times seemed like the industry of the\nfuture will be putting CO2 down into the ground, not taking it out. What\nhappened out in Harding County was almost the opening of Pandora's box.\nA hundred years ago, before there was a dry ice industry in the US, newspaper\narticles already speculated as to the possibility of global warming by CO2. At\nthe time, it was often presented as a positive outcome: all the CO2 released\nby burning coal would warm the environment and thus reduce the need for that\ncoal, possibly even a self-balancing problem. It's even more ironic that CO2\nwas extracted mostly to make things colder, given the longer-term consequences.\nGiven all that, you would be forgiven for assuming that drilling for CO2 was a\nthing of the past.</p>\n<p>The CO2 extraction industry has always been linked to the oil industry, and oil has\nalways been boom and bust. In 1982, there were 16 CO2 wells operating in the\nBravo Dome field. At the end of 1985, just three years later, there were 258.\nDespite the almost total collapse of demand for CO2 refrigeration, demand for liquid\nCO2 was up by far. It turns out that American Production hadn't screwed up in\n1917, at least not if they had known a little more about petroleum engineering.</p>\n<p>In 1972, the Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators Committee of West Texas started\nan experiment, attempting industrial application of a technique first proposed\nin the 1950s. Through a network of non-productive oil wells in the Permian Basin,\nthey injected liquid CO2 deep underground. The rapidly evaporating liquid raised\nthe pressure in the overall oil formation, and even lubricated and somewhat\nfractured the rock, all of which increased the flow rate at nearby oil wells.\nA decade later, the concept was proven, and CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)\nswept across the Permian Basin.</p>\n<p>Today, it is estimated that about 62% of the global industrial production of CO2\nis injected into the ground somewhere in North America to stimulate oil production.\nThe original SACROC system is still running, now up to 414 injection wells. There\nare thousands more. Every day, over two billion cubic feet of CO2 are forced into\nthe ground, pushing back up 245,000 barrels of additional oil.</p>\n<p>British Petroleum's acquisition of American Production proved fortuitous. BP\nbecame one of the country's largest producers of CO2, extracted from the ground\naround Bueyeros and transported by pipeline directly to the Permian Basin for\ninjection. In 2000, BP sold their Bravo Dome operations to Occidental Petroleum <sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup>.\nNow going by Oxy, the petroleum giant has adopted a slogan of &quot;Zero In&quot;. That's\nzero as in carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>I would not have expected to describe Occidental Petroleum as &quot;woke,&quot; but in our\ncontemporary politics they stand out. Oxy mentions &quot;Diversity, Inclusion, and\nBelonging&quot; on the front page of their website, which was once attractive to\ninvestors but now seems more attractive to our nation's increasingly vindictive\nfederal government. Still, Oxy is sticking to a corporate strategy that involves\nacknowledging climate change as real, which I suppose counts as refreshing.\nFrom a 2025 annual report:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oxy is building an integrated portfolio of low-carbon projects, products,\ntechnologies and companies that complement our existing businesses; leveraging\nour competitive advantages in CO2 EOR, reservoir management, drilling,\nessential chemicals and major infrastructure projects; and are designed to\nsustain long term shareholder value as we work to implement our Net-Zero\nStrategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, Oxy has made achieving net-zero carbon a major part of their brand, and\nyes, this model of reducing carbon emissions relies heavily on CO2 EOR: the\nextraction of CO2 from the ground.</p>\n<p>In a faltering effort to address carbon emissions, the United States has leaned\nheavily on the promise of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies. The\nidea is to take CO2 out of the environment (potentially by separating it from\nthe air but, more practically, by capturing it in places where it is already\nconcentrated by industrial processes) and to put it somewhere else. Yes, this\nhas shades of the Australian television sketch about the ship whose front fell\noff, but the key to &quot;sequestration&quot; is time. If we can put enough carbon\nsomewhere that it will say for enough time, we can reduce the &quot;active&quot; greenhouse\ngas content of our environment. The main way we have found of doing this is\ninjecting it deep underground. How convenient, then, that the oil industry is\nalready looking for CO2 for EOR.</p>\n<p>CCS has struggled in many ways, chief among them that the majority of planned\nCCS projects have never been built. As with most of our modern carbon reduction\neconomy, even the CCS that has been built is, well, a little bit questionable.\nThere is something of a Faustian bargain with fossil fuels. As we speak, about\n45 megatons of CO2 are captured from industrial processes each year for CCS. Of\nthat 45 Mt, 9 Mt are injected into dedicated CO2 sequestration projects. The\nrest, 80%, is purchased by the oil industry for use in EOR.</p>\n<p>This form of CCS, in which the captured CO2 is applied to an industrial\nprocess that leads to the production of more CO2, has taken to the name\nCCUS. That's Carbon Capture, <em>Utilization,</em> and Storage. Since the majority\nof the CO2 injected for EOR never comes back up, it is a form of sequestration.\nAlthough the additional oil produced will generally be burned, producing CO2,\nthe process can be said to be <em>inefficient in terms of CO2</em>. In other words,\nthe CO2 produced by burning oil from EOR is less in volume than the CO2\ninjected to stimulate recovery of that oil.</p>\n<div class=\"beg\">\n<hr />\n<p>I put a lot of time into writing this, and I hope that you enjoy reading\nit. If you can spare a few dollars, consider <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/jbcrawford\">supporting me on\nko-fi</a>. You'll receive an occasional extra,\nsubscribers-only post, and defray the costs of providing artisanal, hand-built\nworld wide web directly from Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>\n<hr />\n</div>\n<p>Mathematically, CCUS, the use of CO2 to produce oil, leads to a net reduction\nin released CO2. Philosophically, though, it is deeply unsatisfying. This is\nmade all the worse by the fact that CCUS has benefited from significant\ngovernment support. Outright subsidies for CCS are uncommon, although\nthey do exist. What <em>are</em> quite common are grants and subsidized financing\nfor the capital costs of CCS facilities. Nearly all CCS in the US has been\nbuilt with some degree of government funding, totaling at least four billion\ndollars, and regulatory requirements for CCS to offset new fossil fuel plants\nmay create a de facto electrical ratepayer subsidy for CCS. Most of that\nfinancial support, intended for our low-carbon future, goes to the oil\nproducers.</p>\n<p>The Permian Basin is well-positioned for CCS EOR because it produces mostly\nnatural gas. Natural gas in its raw form, &quot;well gas,&quot; almost always includes\nCO2. Natural gas processing plants separate the combustible gases from\nnoncombustible ones, producing natural gas that has a higher energy content\nand burns more cleanly—but, in the process, venting large quantities of CO2\ninto the atmosphere. Oxy is equipping its Permian Basin natural gas plants\nwith a capture system that collects the CO2 and compresses it for use in EOR.</p>\n<p>The problem is that CO2 consumption for EOR has, as always, outpaced\nproduction. There aren't enough carbon capture systems to supply the Permian\nBasin fields, so &quot;sequestered&quot; CO2 is mixed with &quot;new&quot; CO2. Bravo Dome CO2\nproduction has slowly declined since the 1990s, due mostly to declining\noil prices. Even so, northeastern New Mexico is still full of Oxy wells bringing up\nCO2 by the millions of cubic feet. 218 miles of pipeline deliver Bueyeros CO2\ninto West Texas, and 120 miles of pipeline the other way land it in the oil\nfields of Wyoming. There is very nearly one producing CO2 well\nper person in Harding County.</p>\n<p>Considering the totality of the system, it appears that government grants,\nfinancing incentives, and tax credits for CCS are subsidizing not only natural\ngas production but the extraction of CO2 itself. Whether this is progress on\nclimate change or a complete farce depends a mathematical analysis. CO2 goes in,\nfrom several different sources; CO2 goes out, to several different dispositions.\nDo we remove more from the atmosphere than we end up putting back? There isn't\nan obvious answer.</p>\n<p>The oil industry maintains that CCS is one of the most practical means of reducing\ncarbon emissions, with more CO2 injected than produced and a resulting reduction\nin the &quot;net CO2 impact&quot; of the product natural gas.</p>\n<p>As for more independent researchers, well, a paper finding that CCS EOR\n&quot;cannot contribute to reductions&quot; isn't the worst news. A 2020 literature\nreview of reports on CCS EOR projects found that they routinely fail to\naccount for significant secondary carbon emissions and that, due to a mix\nof the construction and operational realities of CCS EOR facilities and\nthe economics of oil consumption, CCS EOR has so far produced a modest net\n<em>increase</em> in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n<p>They're still out there today, drilling for carbon dioxide. The reports from\nthe petroleum institute today say that the Permian Basin might need even\nmore shipped in. New Mexico is an oil state; Texas gets the reputation but\nNew Mexico has the numbers. Per-capita oil production here is significantly\nhigher than Texas and second only to North Dakota. New Mexico now produces\nmore oil than Old Mexico, if you will, the country to our south.</p>\n<p>Per capita, New Mexico ranks 12th for CO2 emissions, responsible for about\n1% of the nation's total. Well, I can do a bit better: for CO2 intentionally\nextracted from the ground, New Mexico is #3, behind only Colorado and\nMississippi for total production. We produce something around 17% of the\nnation's supply of extracted CO2, and we even use most of it locally. I\nguess that's something you could put a good spin on.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>By this time, Armand Hammer was no longer CEO of Occidental, which is\nunfortunate since it deprives me of an excuse to talk at length about how\nutterly bizarre Armand Hammer was, and about the United World College he\nfounded in Las Vegas, NM.

Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one&#8217;s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.</p>\n<p>The malware that turns one&#8217;s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic &#8212; including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.</p>\n<p>Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from <strong>IPIDEA</strong>, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forward malicious commands</a> to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint&#8217;s local network.</p>\n<p>Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf&#8217;s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes.

    "content": "<div class=\"wikitext\"><p>An interesting change to IP behavior landed in FreeBSD 15, <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/77411\">as I\ndiscovered by accident</a>.\nTo quote from <a href=\"https://www.freebsd.org/releases/15.0R/relnotes/#network-general\">the general networking section of the FreeBSD 15\nrelease notes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Making a connection to <code>INADDR_ANY</code>, i.e., using\nit as an alias for <code>localhost</code>, is now disabled by\ndefault. This functionality can be re-enabled by setting the\n<code>net.inet.ip.connect_inaddr_wild sysctl</code> to 1. <a href=\"https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=cd240957d7ba\">cd240957d7ba</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=cd240957d7ba\">The change's commit message</a> has a bit\nof a different description:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Previously connect() or sendto() to INADDR_ANY reached some socket\nbound to some host interface address. Although this was intentional it\nwas an artifact of a different era, and is not desirable now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is connected to <a href=\"https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=417b35a97b76\">an earlier change</a>\nand <a href=\"https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=280705\">FreeBSD bugzilla #28075</a>, which has\nsome additional background and motivation for the overall change (as\nwell as the history of this feature in 4.x BSD).</p>\n\n<p>The (current) Linux default behavior matches the previous FreeBSD\nbehavior. If you had something listening on localhost (in IPv4,\nspecifically 127.0.0.1) or listening on INADDR_ANY, connecting\nto INADDR_ANY would reach it and give the source of your\nconnection a localhost address (either 127.0.0.1 or ::1 depending\non IPv4 versus IPv6). Obviously the current FreeBSD default behavior\nhas now changed, and the Linux behavior may change at some point\n(or at least become something that can be changed by a sysctl).</p>\n\n<p>(Linux specifically restricts you to connecting to 127.0.0.1;\nyou can't reach a port listening on, eg, 127.0.0.10, although\nthat is also a localhost address.)</p>\n\n<p>One of the tricky API issues here is that higher level APIs can\noften be persuaded or tricked into using INADDR_ANY by default\nwhen they connect to something. For example, in Go's <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/net\">net</a> package, if you leave the hostname blank,\nyou currently get INADDR_ANY (which is convenient behavior for\nlistening but not necessarily for connecting). In other APIs, your\naddress variable may start with an initial zero value for the target\nIP address, which is INADDR_ANY for IPv4; if your code never\nsets it (perhaps because the 'host' is a blank string), you get a\nconnection to INADDR_ANY and thus to localhost. In top of that,\na blank host name to connect to may have come about through accident\nor through an attacker's action (perhaps they can make decoding or\nparsing the host name fail, leaving the 'host name' blank on you).</p>\n\n<p>I believe that what's happening with Go's tests is that the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/net\">net</a>\npackage guarantees that things like <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/net#Dial\">net.Dial(\"tcp\", \":&lt;port>\")</a> connect to localhost, so of course\nthe net package has tests to insure that this stays working.\nCurrently, Go's net package implements this behavior by mapping a\nblank host to INADDR_ANY, which has traditionally worked and\nbeen the easiest way to get the behavior Go wants. It also means\nthat Go can use uniform parsing of 'host:port' for both listening,\nwhere ':port' is required to mean listening on INADDR_ANY, and\nfor connecting, where the host has to be localhost. Since this is\na high level API, Go can change how the mapping works, and it pretty\nmuch has to in order to fully work as documented on FreeBSD 15 in\na stock configuration.</p>\n\n<p>(Because that would be a big change to land right before the release\nof Go 1.26, I suspect that the first bugfix that will land is to\nskip these tests on FreeBSD, or maybe only on FreeBSD 15+ if that's\neasy to detect.)</p>\n</div>\n",

Primogeniture did important work by keeping dynastic fortunes intact, rather than dividing them up among all children of some baron or lord or other guillotineable monster.</p>\n<p>Primogeniture persisted until the age of colonization, when Europe's \"great powers\" stole the rest of the world. In that moment, the size of Europe's great fortunes expanded by orders of magnitude. This vast increase in the wealth of Europe's most murderous, remorseless looters made primogeniture obsolete. There was so much blood-soaked money available to the nobility that <em>every</em> son could found a \"great house.\"</p>\n<p>After a couple generations' worth of this, the colonies were exhausted. There were no more lands to conquer, which meant that every son could no longer expect to found his own fortune. But for these chinless masters of the universe, a world where every son of every rich man wouldn't get his own dynasty was incomprehensible. To do otherwise was literally unimaginable. It was <em>unnatural</em>.</p>\n<p>For Piketty, this explained World War I: the world's chinless inbred monsters embarking upon an orgy of bloodletting to relieve one another of the lands &#8211; and peoples &#8211; they'd claimed as their property in order to carry on the \"eternal\" tradition of every son starting his own fortune.</p>\n<p>It's a very important idea, and a provocative explanation for one of the 20th Century's defining events. That's why it struck me so hard when I first read it, but the reason it stuck with me for the decade-plus since I encountered that it is a vital observation about the human condition: as a species, we <em>forget</em> so much. Something that was commonplace a generation ago becomes unimaginable today, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Even people who lived through those years forget who they were and what they took for granted in those days. Think, for example, of all those evangelicals who would vote for Satan himself if he promised to hang any woman who obtained an abortion; the same evangelicals who, just a few decades ago, viewed anti-abortionism as a politically suspect form of crypto-papacy:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/18/schizmogenesis/\">https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/18/schizmogenesis/</a></p>\n<p>Perhaps the reason Piketty's primogeniture-based explanation for WWI struck me so forcefully and durably is that I imbibed a prodigious amount of science fiction as a boy, including the aphorism that \"all laws are local, and no law knows how local it is\":</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-cosmopolitan-literature-for-the-cosmopolitan-web/\">https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-cosmopolitan-literature-for-the-cosmopolitan-web/</a></p>\n<p>In other words, things that seem eternal and innate to the human condition to you are apt to have been invented ten minutes before you started to notice the world around you and might seem utterly alien to your children. As Douglas Adams put it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams\">https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams</a></p>\n<p>This notion is much on my mind right now because the world is (to me, at least) unassailably in a state of change, and everything is up for grabs. Europe went from 15 years <em>behind</em> on its climate goals to <em>ten years ahead of schedule</em> after the supply of Russian gas dried up and Europeans found themselves shivering in the dark. The massive leap in EU solar means that the (seemingly) all-powerful fossil fuel lobby has absolutely, comprehensively <em>eaten shit</em>, something that was unthinkable just a few years ago:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle</a></p>\n<p>Indeed, this happened so fast that many people (including many Europeans) <em>haven't even noticed that it happened</em>. Back in December, when I was at CCC in Hamburg, I talked to a bunch of European activists, close watchers of the Commission and the Parliament, who were completely convinced that Europe would never spurn the fossil fuel sector &#8211; despite the fact that <em>it had already happened</em>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it may be that intimate familiarity with European politics is a liability when things change. Spend enough time observing up close how supine European politicians and their Eurocrats are and you may find yourself so reflexively conditioned to view them as spineless corporate lackeys and thus unable to notice when they finally dig up a vertebra or two.</p>\n<p>Smart financiers are familiar with Stein's Law: \"anything that can't go on forever eventually stops.\" Change happens. Eternal verities might be fifteen minutes older than you. Pink used to be the color of ferocious masculinity, whereas blue was so girly as to be practically titular:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendered_associations_of_pink_and_blue\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendered_associations_of_pink_and_blue</a></p>\n<p>Real talk: I have serious, debilitating chronic pain. One of the reasons I'm so prolific is that the only time I stop noticing how much I hurt is when I'm lost in work (compartmentalization is a hell of a drug, and while it's not <em>always</em> healthy, it has its upsides). Ask anyone with chronic pain and they'll tell you that treating pain eventually becomes your hobby, a bottomless well of esoteric dives into various \"modalities\" of pain treatment.</p>\n<p>Thus it is that I've found myself on one or two psychologists' couches, learning about different mental approaches to living with constant pain. One of the most useful pieces of advice I've gotten was to attend closely to how my pain changes &#8211; how it ebbs and flows. The point is that if pain changes, that means that it <em>can</em> change. It <em>feels</em> eternal, but it comes and goes. Maybe someday it will go altogether. And even if it doesn't, it may improve. It probably will, at least for a while.</p>\n<p>Things change.</p>\n<p>Our current crop of cowardly, weak appeasers &#8211; in Congress, in Parliament, in the European Parliament &#8211; have, at various times (and very recently), found their spines. The factions within them that militated for the kind of bold action that might meet this moment have, from time to time, won the day. We have lived through total transformations in our politics before, and that means we might live through them again:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hypertext.niskanencenter.org/p/the-fragmentation-flywheel\">https://hypertext.niskanencenter.org/p/the-fragmentation-flywheel</a></p>\n<p>Sure, it's easy and tempting to assume that our leaders will always suck as hard as they suck now. But latent in that assumption is that the leaders who presided over big, incredible transformations were exceptional people. Maybe they were and maybe they weren't, but I'm here to tell you, ten minutes' worth of research into the biographies of the \"heroes\" of our history will reveal them to have been every bit as capable of monstrousness, cowardice, cruelty and pig-ignorant bigotry as any of today's rotating cast of fascist goons:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/disrupting-the-myth-of-franklin-d-roosevelt-in-the-age-of-trump-sanders-and-clinton/\">https://truthout.org/articles/disrupting-the-myth-of-franklin-d-roosevelt-in-the-age-of-trump-sanders-and-clinton/</a></p>\n<p>The question isn't merely \"How do we elect better leaders?\" It's \"How do we make our leaders follow <em>us</em>?\" Today's Democrats are unserious quislings who keep bringing a squirt-gun to a mass-casualty assault-rifle spree-shooting. How do we terrorize these cowards into rising to the moment? If we want Congressional Democrats to form a Nuremburg Caucus and start holding hearings on who they're going to put in the dock when the Trump regime collapses, we're going to have to drive them to it.</p>\n<p>And we <em>can</em>! The Democrats who gave us the New Deal weren't braver or more moral than the self-dealing millionaires in Congress today &#8211; they were <em>more afraid of their base</em>.</p>\n<p>Things change.</p>\n<p>Some years ago, I gave a speech at Consumer Reports headquarters in Poughkeepsie, trying to get them to refuse to give a passing grade to <em>any</em> product with DRM, on the grounds that the manufacturer could alter how that device worked at any time in the future, meaning that no matter how well a device worked now, it might turn into a pile of shit at any time in the future:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.soundguys.com/the-sonos-app-death-spiral-132873/\">https://www.soundguys.com/the-sonos-app-death-spiral-132873/</a></p>\n<p>They didn't take me up on this suggestion, obviously. They made the (seemingly) reasonable point that people bought Consumer Reports to find out what to buy, not to be told that they shouldn't buy <em>anything</em>. Every product in many key categories came with DRM, meaning that their recommendation would have had to be \"just don't buy any of it.\"</p>\n<p>But today, consumer review sites do sometimes recommend <em>nothing</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/\">https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/</a></p>\n<p>And of course, there's some precedent here. Somewhere between the emergence of the evidence for seatbelts and the appearance of seatbelts in most makes and models of cars, there would have been a time when the answer to \"which car should I buy?\" was \"don't buy a car, they're all unsafe at any speed.\"</p>\n<p>Things change. Today, every car has a seatbelt, and they'd continue to do so, even if we did away with regulations requiring seatbelts. Driving a car without a seatbelt would be as weird and terrible as using a radium suppository:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/19/just-stop-putting-that-up-your-ass/#harm-reduction\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/19/just-stop-putting-that-up-your-ass/#harm-reduction</a></p>\n<p>Things change. The nine-justice Supreme Court isn't an eternal verity. It didn't come down off a mountain on two stone tablets. It's about ten seconds old:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869</a></p>\n<p>Tomorrow, it will be different:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/20/judicial-equilibria/#pack-the-court\">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/20/judicial-equilibria/#pack-the-court</a></p>\n<p>Our eternals are all ephemerals. The idea that we should tax capital gains at half the rate of wages? It was practically invented yesterday. You know who thought we should tax all income at the same rate? That noted Bolshevik, Ronald fuckin' Reagan:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/flashback-reagan-raised-capital-gains-taxes-to-the-same-level-as-wage-taxes-for-first-time-444438edf242/\">https://archive.thinkprogress.org/flashback-reagan-raised-capital-gains-taxes-to-the-same-level-as-wage-taxes-for-first-time-444438edf242/</a></p>\n<p>We're living through a time of change. Much of it is calamitous. Some of it wondrous:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting</a></p>\n<p>It's so easy to slip into the habit of thinking that nothing will change, that our politicians will never fear us more than they love the money and power they get from catering to the Epstein class. I'm not denying that this is how they view the world today, but there was a time in living memory when it wasn't true. If it changed before, it can change again:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change\">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change</a></p>\n<p>Things change.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\n<h1 heds=\"0\">Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/05/contingency/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\"/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Scourge of Online Sports Betting <a href=\"https://prospect.org/2026/02/04/feb-2026-magazine-sports-scourge-online-betting-fanduel-draftkings/\">https://prospect.org/2026/02/04/feb-2026-magazine-sports-scourge-online-betting-fanduel-draftkings/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ICE has offices in 5 Canadian cities.

    "link": "https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/get-all-the-reactions-to-your-github-content-using-graphql/",
    "content": "<p>I am both vain <em>and</em> prurient. A combination which makes me fun at parties and a delight to know.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes when I raise an issue on GitHub, or write a comment, other users leave me Emoji reactions. Perhaps a 👍 or 🎉 if they like my contribution, but occasionally a 👎 or 😕 if they're foolish enough to think I'm wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, GitHub doesn't tell me that someone has 🚀'd my wisdom. If GitHub was as good as Facebook, it would present a little 🔔 to let me know exactly how many ❤️s I have received. Instead I have to manually check every issue I've raised to see if the hive-mind judges me worthy.</p>\n\n<p>You might be thinking that there's an API for finding the reaction count to a specific piece of content - and you'd be right! The only problem is that <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reactions/reactions?apiVersion=2022-11-28\">it requires you to send it a <em>specific</em> content ID</a>. So pretty bloody useless unless you want to construct a mega-query of everything you've ever written.</p>\n\n<p>Enter the terrifying world of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/graphql\">GraphQL</a> - where men fear to tread and AIs are driven mad. It is possible to squeeze the API until the pips squeak. Here's a GraphQL query, run using the <code>gh</code> CLI, which grabs any issue with over zero reactions, displays how many reactions it received, and who gave what sort of reaction.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gh api graphql -f query='\nquery {\n  search(query: \"author:@me reactions:&gt;0\", type: ISSUE, first: 10) {\n    nodes {\n      ... on Issue {\n        url\n        reactions(last: 50) {\n          totalCount\n          nodes {\n            content\n            user {\n              login\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you might be able to decipher, that looks for the 10 most recent issues. If you are prolific, you may want to increase that number - although it will increase the time it takes for the query to run. If you have the temerity to dare to retrieve more than 100, you'll be slapped with the dreaded <code>EXCESSIVE_PAGINATION</code> error.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, it only gets the most recent 50 reactions. The count will be be the total number of reactions, no matter how low you set the number.</p>\n\n<p>In return, you'll get a hideous mass of JavaScript which looks like it has been vomited up by a disgruntled Cacodemon:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"search\": {\n      \"nodes\": [\n       {\n          \"url\": \"https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/1814\",\n          \"reactions\": {\n            \"totalCount\": 9,\n            \"nodes\": [\n              {\n                \"content\": \"THUMBS_UP\",\n                \"user\": {\n                  \"login\": \"markohoza\"\n                }\n              },\n              {\n                \"content\": \"EYES\",\n                \"user\": {\n                  \"login\": \"adamwolf\"\n                }\n              },\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is no way to get anything older. If someone liked a comment you made in 2019, you will <em>never</em> know!</p>\n\n<p>If you hate your eyes enough to read through <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#searchtype\">the search type documentation</a>, you'll notice there is no way to search Pull Requests. This is, of course, a rotten lie. If you read <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-only-issues-or-pull-requests\">different documentation</a> you'll see that PRs are classed as a type of issue. Why? Because your sanity is not worth the cost of updating things.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it makes our life slightly easier. We can search both Issues and PRs in one easy to chew lump of GraphQL:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gh api graphql -f query='\nquery {\n  search(query: \"author:@me reactions:&gt;0\", type: ISSUE, first: 100) {\n    nodes {\n      ... on Issue {\n        url\n        reactions(last: 100) {\n          totalCount\n          nodes {\n            content\n            user {\n              login\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ... on PullRequest {\n        url\n        reactions(last: 100) {\n          totalCount\n          nodes {\n            content\n            user {\n              login\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, beware gazing into the JSON lest the JSON gazes into <em>you!</em></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"search\": {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"url\": \"https://github.com/WICG/webmonetization/pull/634\",\n          \"reactions\": {\n            \"totalCount\": 2,\n            \"nodes\": [\n              {\n                \"content\": \"CONFUSED\",\n                \"user\": {\n                  \"login\": \"tomayac\"\n                }\n              },\n              {\n                \"content\": \"HEART\",\n                \"user\": {\n                  \"login\": \"tomayac\"\n                }\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        },\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>OK, so it should be pretty damned simple to get the number of reactions to any comments, right? RIGHT?!?!</p>\n\n<p>No. Because consistency is a dirty word and GraphQL was designed in the bowels of hell as a way to keep API developers from ever obtaining a state of grace.</p>\n\n<p>There's no way I could find to use <code>reactions:&gt;0</code> with a comment search query. This will get you lots of useless unreacted results. I guess you can filter them with <code>jq</code> or just scratch your monitor with razor blades so you don't have to see their empty laughing maws.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gh api graphql -f query='\nquery {\n  viewer {\n    issueComments(last: 10) {\n      nodes {\n        url\n        reactions(last: 10) {\n          totalCount\n          nodes {\n            content\n            user {\n              login\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And, again, JSON nested like wheels within wheels and fires within fires:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"viewer\": {\n      \"issueComments\": {\n        \"nodes\": [\n          {\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor/issues/6474#issuecomment-3740347148\",\n            \"reactions\": {\n              \"totalCount\": 0,\n              \"nodes\": []\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/edent/3D-UK-Money/issues/1#issuecomment-3757022146\",\n            \"reactions\": {\n              \"totalCount\": 1,\n              \"nodes\": [\n                {\n                  \"content\": \"THUMBS_UP\",\n                  \"user\": {\n                    \"login\": \"MickeyF2010\"\n                  }\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-have-we-learned-today\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/get-all-the-reactions-to-your-github-content-using-graphql/#what-have-we-learned-today\">What Have We Learned Today?</a></h2>\n\n<p>The Necronomicon was probably written in GraphQL. Any form of Daemon summoning <em>must</em> use nested queries and frightening syntax.</p>\n\n<p>Trying to track reactions to your content <em>will</em> drive you mad.

    "title": "Git’s Magic Files",
    "link": "https://nesbitt.io/2026/02/05/git-magic-files.html",
    "content": "<p>A follow-up to my post on <a href=\"/2025/11/26/extending-git-functionality.html\">extending git functionality</a>. Git looks for several special files in your repository that control its behavior. These aren’t configuration files in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.git/</code>, they’re committed files that travel with your code and affect how git treats your files.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re building a tool that works with git repositories, like <a href=\"https://github.com/git-pkgs/git-pkgs\">git-pkgs</a>, you’ll want to ensure you respect these configs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gitignore\">.gitignore</h3>\n\n<p>Patterns of files git should never track. One pattern per line, supports wildcards and directory markers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>node_modules/\n*.log\n.env\ndist/\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Git checks multiple ignore files in order: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitignore</code> in each directory, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.git/info/exclude</code> for local-only ignores, and the global ignore file at <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.config/git/ignore</code> or wherever <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">core.excludesFile</code> points. Global ignores are good for OS-specific files like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.DS_Store</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Thumbs.db</code> that shouldn’t clutter every project’s <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitignore</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern matching supports wildcards (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">*.log</code>), directory markers (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dist/</code>), negation (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">!important.log</code>), and character ranges. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">**</code> pattern matches nested directories.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea all respect <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitignore</code> and won’t show ignored files in the web UI. Package managers often ship with their own ignore patterns (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">node_modules/</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">target/</code>) that you’re expected to add to your ignore file.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore\">gitignore docs</a> for the full pattern syntax. GitHub maintains <a href=\"https://github.com/github/gitignore\">a collection of .gitignore templates</a> for different languages and frameworks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gitattributes\">.gitattributes</h3>\n\n<p>Tells git how to handle specific files. This is where you configure filters, diff drivers, merge drivers, line ending normalization, and language detection overrides.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># Clean/smudge filters\n*.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs\n\n# Line ending normalization\n*.sh text eol=lf\n*.bat text eol=crlf\n\n# Treat as binary\n*.png binary\n\n# Custom diff driver\n*.json diff=json\n\n# Merge strategy\npackage-lock.json merge=ours\n\n# Language detection override for GitHub Linguist\nvendor/* linguist-vendored\n*.gen.go linguist-generated\ndocs/* linguist-documentation\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">text</code> attribute tells git to normalize line endings. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">binary</code> attribute tells git not to diff or merge, just pick one version. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">merge=ours</code> strategy always keeps your version during merge conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub Linguist reads <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitattributes</code> to override its language detection. Mark vendored code with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">linguist-vendored</code> to exclude it from language statistics. Mark generated files with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">linguist-generated</code> to collapse them in diffs. Mark documentation with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">linguist-documentation</code> to exclude it from stats.</p>\n\n<p>Like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitignore</code>, git checks <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitattributes</code> files in each directory and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.git/info/attributes</code> for local-only attributes.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes\">gitattributes docs</a> cover all attributes. The <a href=\"https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/docs/overrides.md\">GitHub Linguist docs</a> list its specific attributes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lfsconfig\">.lfsconfig</h3>\n\n<p>Git LFS configuration that travels with the repository. Uses git config format to set the LFS endpoint URL, transfer settings, and other LFS options.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>[lfs]\n    url = https://lfs.example.com/repo\n[lfs \"transfer\"]\n    maxretries = 3\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Git LFS reads <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.lfsconfig</code> automatically when you run LFS commands. This lets you commit LFS configuration so everyone working on the repo uses the same settings. Without it, developers need to manually configure their local LFS setup.</p>\n\n<p>LFS also uses <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitattributes</code> to mark which files should be handled by LFS (the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">*.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs</code> pattern shown above). The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.lfsconfig</code> file handles the LFS-specific settings like where to find the LFS server. If you add file patterns to LFS after files are already committed, you need to run <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git lfs migrate</code> to rewrite history and move those files into LFS.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-config.adoc\">Git LFS config docs</a> for all available options.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gitmodules\">.gitmodules</h3>\n\n<p>Configuration for git submodules. Git writes this file when you run <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git submodule add</code> and reads it when you run <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git submodule update</code>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>[submodule \"vendor/lib\"]\n    path = vendor/lib\n    url = https://github.com/example/lib.git\n    branch = main\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Each submodule gets an entry with its path, URL, and optionally the branch to track. The file lives at the root of your repository.</p>\n\n<p>Submodules let you embed other git repositories as dependencies. Running <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git clone</code> doesn’t fetch submodule content automatically, you need <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git submodule update --init --recursive</code> or pass <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">--recurse-submodules</code> to clone.</p>\n\n<p>They don’t handle versioning well (you track a specific commit, not a version range), they create nested <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.git</code> directories, and forgetting to update them creates confusing states.</p>\n\n<p>But submodules work fine for vendoring code you control or for monorepo structures where you want to check out only part of the tree.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule\">git submodules docs</a> explain the full workflow. The <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmodules\">gitmodules docs</a> cover the file format.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mailmap\">.mailmap</h3>\n\n<p>Maps author names and email addresses to canonical identities. Git uses this for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git log</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git shortlog</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git blame</code> output.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># Map old email to new email\nJane Developer &lt;jane@company.com&gt; &lt;jane@oldcompany.com&gt;\n\n# Standardize name spelling\nJane Developer &lt;jane@company.com&gt; Jane Dev &lt;jane@company.com&gt;\n\n# Fix both\nJane Developer &lt;jane@company.com&gt; &lt;janed@personal.com&gt;\nJane Developer &lt;jane@company.com&gt; J Developer &lt;janed@personal.com&gt;\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The format is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Proper Name &lt;proper@email.com&gt; Commit Name &lt;commit@email.com&gt;</code>. Git looks for entries matching the commit author and rewrites the output.</p>\n\n<p>This matters for contributor statistics. GitHub’s contributor graphs use mailmap. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git shortlog -sn</code> uses it to count commits per author. Tools analyzing commit history use it.</p>\n\n<p>Without mailmap, contributors who changed email addresses or fixed typos in their names show up as multiple people. With it, all their commits aggregate under one identity.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap\">gitmailmap docs</a> cover the file format. You can put mailmap at <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.mailmap</code> in the repo root or configure <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mailmap.file</code> to point elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"git-blame-ignore-revs\">.git-blame-ignore-revs</h3>\n\n<p>Lists commits that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git blame</code> should skip. Put the commit SHA of bulk formatting changes, linting passes, or other noise commits in this file and blame will look through them to find the meaningful change.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># .git-blame-ignore-revs\n# Ran prettier on entire codebase\na1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0\n\n# Migrated to ESLint flat config\nb2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Configure git to use it with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs</code>. GitHub, GitLab (15.4+), and Gitea all read this file automatically without configuration.</p>\n\n<p>This solves the problem where running a formatter on the entire codebase makes <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git blame</code> useless. With this file, blame skips those commits and shows the actual author of the logic.</p>\n\n<p>The file format is simple: one commit SHA per line, with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">#</code> for comments. See the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt\">git blame docs</a> for details.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gitmessage\">.gitmessage</h3>\n\n<p>A template for commit messages. You configure this with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git config commit.template .gitmessage</code> and git will pre-fill the commit message editor with this content.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># .gitmessage\n# &lt;type&gt;: &lt;subject&gt;\n#\n# &lt;body&gt;\n#\n# &lt;footer&gt;\n#\n# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Unlike the other files in this post, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitmessage</code> requires manual configuration per clone. Each developer needs to run <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git config commit.template .gitmessage</code> after cloning. Some teams automate this with a setup script or use tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/typicode/husky\">husky</a> to set local configs during installation. This extra step is why most projects prefer <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">commit-msg</code> hooks to validate format rather than templates to guide writing.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#_discussion\">git commit docs</a> mention template files. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">prepare-commit-msg</code> hook is an alternative that can generate dynamic templates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"forge-specific-folders\">Forge-Specific Folders</h2>\n\n<p>Git forges extend repositories with their own magic folders: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.github/</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitlab/</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitea/</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.forgejo/</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.bitbucket/</code>. These aren’t git features, but they follow the same pattern: configuration that travels with your code.</p>\n\n<p>Inside these folders you’ll find CI/CD workflows, issue and PR templates, CODEOWNERS files mapping paths to required reviewers, and other forge-specific configuration. The folders let forges add features without polluting the repository root.</p>\n\n<p>Forgejo and Gitea have fallback chains. Forgejo checks <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.forgejo/</code> → <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitea/</code> → <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.github/</code>. Gitea checks <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitea/</code> → <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.github/</code>. This lets you override GitHub-specific config when hosting on multiple platforms.</p>\n\n<p>SourceHut uses <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.build.yml</code> at the root or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.builds/*.yml</code> for CI, without a dedicated folder namespace.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-conventions\">Other Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>.gitkeep</strong> is a convention, not a git feature. Git doesn’t track empty directories. If you want an empty directory in your repository, you put a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitkeep</code> file in it so git has something to track. The filename <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitkeep</code> is arbitrary, it could be anything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>.gitconfig</strong> files sometimes appear in repositories as suggested configuration. Git won’t load these automatically (security reasons), but projects include them with instructions to run <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git config include.path ../.gitconfig</code> or manually copy settings. Common in monorepos or projects with specific git settings they want to standardize.</p>\n\n<p><strong>.gitsigners</strong> or similar files track GPG/SSH signing keys for trusted contributors. Not a native git feature, but used by some projects (notably the Linux kernel) as part of their signing workflow. Git’s <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile</code> config can point to a file of trusted SSH keys that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git log --show-signature</code> uses for verification.</p>\n\n<p><strong>.gitreview</strong> configures <a href=\"https://www.gerritcodereview.com/\">Gerrit</a> code review integration. Used by projects hosted on Gerrit (OpenStack, Android, Eclipse) to specify which Gerrit server and project to push to.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>[gerrit]\nhost=review.opendev.org\nport=29418\nproject=openstack/nova.git\ndefaultbranch=master\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Running <a href=\"https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/git-review/latest/\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git review</code></a> reads this file and pushes commits to Gerrit for review instead of directly to the branch. It’s a canonical example of a tool extending git’s workflow through a committed config file.</p>\n\n<p><strong>.gitlint</strong> configures <a href=\"https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/\">gitlint</a> for commit message linting. Follows the same pattern: commit the config, everyone gets the same rules.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>[general]\nignore=body-is-missing\n\n[title-max-length]\nline-length=72\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Gitlint reads this to validate commit message format. Similar to using a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">commit-msg</code> hook but with the configuration traveling with the repository.</p>\n\n<p><strong>.jj/</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj\">Jujutsu</a>’s working copy state directory. Jujutsu is a git-compatible VCS that stores its own metadata in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.jj/</code> while respecting all of git’s magic files. If you use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">jj</code>, you’ll have both <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.git/</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.jj/</code> in your repository, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitignore</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitattributes</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.mailmap</code> all work the same way.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"beyond-git\">Beyond Git</h2>\n\n<p>The pattern extends beyond git. Other tools follow the same approach: drop a dotfile in your repository, tools detect it automatically, behavior changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>.editorconfig</strong> standardizes editor behavior across teams. Put it at the root of your repo and editors read it to configure indent style, line endings, trailing whitespace, and character encoding.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root = true\n\n[*]\nindent_style = space\nindent_size = 2\nend_of_line = lf\ncharset = utf-8\ntrim_trailing_whitespace = true\n\n[*.md]\ntrim_trailing_whitespace = false\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Sublime, and most other editors either support it natively or have plugins. See <a href=\"https://editorconfig.org/\">editorconfig.org</a> for the full spec.</p>\n\n<p><strong>.ruby-version</strong>, <strong>.node-version</strong>, <strong>.python-version</strong> tell version managers which language version to use. Tools like rbenv, nodenv, pyenv, nvm, and asdf read these files when you <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cd</code> into the directory and automatically switch versions.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># .ruby-version\n3.3.0\n\n# .node-version\n20.11.0\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p><strong>.tool-versions</strong> is asdf’s multi-language version file. One file for all languages.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>ruby 3.3.0\nnodejs 20.11.0\npython 3.12.0\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p><strong>.dockerignore</strong> works like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitignore</code> but for Docker build context. When you run <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">docker build</code>, Docker sends files to the daemon. List patterns in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.dockerignore</code> and Docker won’t send them.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>.git\nnode_modules\n*.log\n.env\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This speeds up builds and keeps secrets out of images. The syntax matches <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitignore</code>: wildcards, negation, directory markers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"supporting-these-files\">Supporting These Files</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re building tools that interact with git repositories, you probably want to respect these files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Read <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitignore</code> when walking the repository tree</li>\n  <li>Read <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitattributes</code> to know which files are binary, vendored, or generated</li>\n  <li>Read <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.mailmap</code> when displaying author information</li>\n  <li>Read <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitmodules</code> if you need to handle submodules</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The git config format (used by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.gitmodules</code> and various other files) is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[section \"subsection\"] key = value</code>. Git ships a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git config</code> command that reads and writes these files correctly. Most languages have git config parsers in their git libraries.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>If you know of other git magic files or have corrections, reach out on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@andrewnez\">Mastodon</a> or submit a pull request on <a href=\"https://github.com/andrew/nesbitt.io\">GitHub</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Heritability of intrinsic human life span is about 50% when heritability is redefined to be something completely different",
    "link": "https://dynomight.net/lifespan/",
    "content": "<p>How heritable is hair color? Well, if you’re a redhead and you have an identical twin, they will definitely also be a redhead. But the age at which twins go gray seems to vary a bit based on lifestyle. And there’s some randomness in where melanocytes end up on your skull when you’re an embryo. And your twin might dye their hair! So the correct answer is, some large number, but less than 100%.</p>\n\n<p>OK, but check this out: Say I redefine “hair color” to mean “hair color except ignoring epigenetic and embryonic stuff and pretending that no one ever goes gray or dyes their hair et cetera”. Now, hair color is 100% heritable. Amazing, right?</p>\n\n<p>Or—how heritable is IQ? The wise man answers, “Some number between 0% or 100%, it’s not that important, please don’t yell at me.” But whatever the number is, it depends on society. In our branch of the multiverse, some kids get private tutors and organic food and $20,000 summer camps, while other kids get dysfunctional schools and lead paint and summers spent drinking Pepsi and staring at glowing rectangles. These things surely have at least <em>some</em> impact on IQ.</p>\n\n<p>But again, watch this: Say I redefine “IQ” to be “IQ in some hypothetical world where every kid got exactly the same school, nutrition, and parenting, so none of those non-genetic factors matter anymore.” Suddenly, the heritability of IQ is higher. Thrilling, right? So much science.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to redefine stuff like this… that’s not <em>wrong</em>. I mean, heritability is a pretty arbitrary concept to start with. So if you prefer to talk about heritability in some other world instead of our actual world, who am I to judge?</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, here’s a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adz1187\">recent paper</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/lifespan/title.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>I stress that this is a perfectly OK paper. I’m picking on it mostly because it was published in Science, meaning—like all Science papers—it makes grand claims but is woefully vague about what those claims mean or what was actually done. Also, publishing in Science is morally wrong and/or makes me envious. So I thought I’d try to explain what’s happening.</p>\n\n<p>It’s actually pretty simple. At least, now that I’ve spent several hours reading the paper and its appendix over and over again, I’ve now convinced myself that it’s pretty simple. So, as a little pedagogical experiment, I’m going to try to explain the paper three times, with varying levels of detail.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explanation-1-the-very-extremely-high-level-picture\">Explanation 1: The very extremely high level picture</h2>\n\n<p>The normal way to estimate the heritability of lifespan is using twin data. Depending on what dataset you use, this will give 23-35%. This paper built a mathematical model that tries to simulate how long people <em>would</em> live in a hypothetical world in which no one dies from any non-aging related cause, meaning no car accidents, no drug overdoses, no suicides, no murders, and no (non-age-related) infectious disease. On that simulated data, for simulated people in a hypothetical world, heritability was 46-57%.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"commentary\">Commentary</h2>\n\n<p>Everyone seems to be interpreting this paper as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aha! We thought the heritability of lifespan was 23-35%. But it turns out that it’s around 50%. Now we know!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand this. Clearly, when the editors at Science chose the title for this paper, their goal was to lead you to that conclusion. But this is not what the paper says. What it says is this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We built a mathematical model of alternate universe in which nobody died from accidents, murder, drug overdoses, or infectious disease. In that model, heritability was about 50%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"explanation-2-the-very-high-level-picture\">Explanation 2: The very high-level picture</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s start over. Here’s figure 2 from the paper.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/lifespan/fig2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Normally, heritability is estimated from twin studies. The idea is that identical twins share 100% of their DNA, while fraternal twins share only 50%. So if some trait is more correlated among identical twins than among fraternal twins, that suggests DNA influences that trait. There are statistics that formalize this intuition. Given a dataset that records how long various identical and fraternal twins lived, these produce a heritability number.</p>\n\n<p>Two such traditional estimates appear as black circles in the above figures. For the Danish twin cohort, lifespan is estimated to be 23% heritable. For the Swedish cohort, it’s 35%.</p>\n\n<p>This paper makes a “twin simulator”. Given historical data, they fit a mathematical model to simulate the lifespans of “new” twins. Then they compute heritability on this simulated data.</p>\n\n<p>Why calculate heritability on simulated data instead of real data? Well, their mathematical model contains an “extrinsic mortality” parameter, which is supposed to reflect the chance of death due to all non-aging-related factors like accidents, murder, or infectious disease. They assume that the chance someone dies from any of this stuff is constant over people, constant over time, and that it accounts for almost all deaths for people aged between 15 and 40.</p>\n\n<p>The point of building the simulator is that it’s possible to <em>change</em> extrinsic mortality. That’s what’s happening in the purple curves in the above figure. For a range of different extrinsic mortality parameters, they simulate datasets of twins. For each simulated dataset, they estimate heritability just like with a real dataset.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the purple curves above nearly hit the black circles. This means that if they run their simulator with extrinsic mortality set to match reality, they get heritability numbers that line up with what we get from real data. That suggests their mathematical model isn’t totally insane.</p>\n\n<p>If you decrease extrinsic mortality, then you decrease the non-genetic randomness in how long people live. So heritability goes up. Hence, the purple curves go up as you go to the left.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"intermission-on-science\">Intermission: On Science</h2>\n\n<p>My explanation of this paper relies on some amount of guesswork. For whatever reason, Science has decided that papers should contain almost no math, even when the paper in question is <em>about</em> math. So I’m mostly working from an English description. But even that description isn’t systematic. There’s no place that clearly lays out all the things they did, in order. Instead, you get little hints, sort of randomly distributed throughout the paper. There’s an appendix, which the paper confidently cites over and over. But if you actually read the appendix, it’s just more disconnected explanations of random things except now with equations set in glorious Microsoft Work format.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in most journals, authors write everything. But Science has professional editors. Given that every single statistics-focused paper in Science seems to be like this, we probably shouldn’t blame the authors of this one. (Other than for their decision to publish in Science in the first place.)</p>\n\n<p>I do wonder what those editors are doing, though. I mean, let me show you something. Here’s the first paragraph where they start to actually explain what they actually did, from the first page:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/lifespan/paragraph.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>See that <em>h(t,θ)</em> at the end? What the hell is that, you ask? That’s a good question, because it was never introduced before this and is never mentioned again. I guess it’s just supposed to be <em>f(t,θ)</em>, which is fine. (I yield to none in my production of typos.) But if paying journals ungodly amounts of money brought us to this, of what use are those journals?</p>\n\n<p>Moving on…</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explanation-3-also-pretty-high-level-but-as-low-as-were-doing-to-go\">Explanation 3: Also pretty high level, but as low as we’re doing to go</h2>\n\n<p>Probably most people don’t need this much detail and should skip this section. For everyone else, let’s start over one last time.</p>\n\n<p>The “normal” way to estimate heritability is by looking at correlations between different kinds of twins. Intuitively, if the lifespans of identical twins are more correlated than the lifespans of fraternal twins, that suggests lifespan is heritable. And it turns out that one estimator for heritability is “twice the difference between the correlation among identical twins and the correlation among fraternal twins, all raised together.” There are other similar estimators for other kinds of twins. These normally say lifespan is perhaps 20% and 35% heritable.</p>\n\n<p>This paper created an equation to model the probability a given person will die at a given age. The parameters of the equation vary from person to person, reflecting that some of us have DNA that predisposes us to live longer than others. But the idea is that the chances of dying are fairly constant between the ages of 15 and 40, after which they start increasing.</p>\n\n<p>This equation contains an “extrinsic mortality” parameter. This is meant to reflect the chance of death due to all non-aging related factors like accidents or murder, etc. They assume this is constant. (Constant with respect to people and constant over time.) Note that they don’t actually look at any data on causes of death. They just add a constant risk of death that’s shared by all people at all ages to the equation, and then they call this “extrinsic mortality”.</p>\n\n<p>Now remember, different people are supposed to have different parameters in their probability-of-death equations. To reflect this, they fit a Gaussian distribution (bell curve) to the parameters with the goal of making it fit with historical data. The idea is that if the distribution over parameters were too broad, you might get lots of people dying at 15 or living until 120, which would be wrong. If the distribution were too concentrated, then you might get everyone dying at 43, which would also be wrong. So they find a good distribution, one that makes the ages people die in simulation look like the ages people actually died in historical data.</p>\n\n<p>Right! So now they have:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>An equation that’s supposed to reflect the probability a given person dies at a given age.</li>\n  <li>A distribution over the parameters of that equation that’s supposed to produce population-wide death ages that look like those in real historical data.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Before moving on, I remind you of two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>They assume their death equation <em>entirely</em> determines the probability someone will die in a given year.</li>\n  <li>They assume that the shape of someone’s death equation is <em>entirely</em> determined by genetics.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The event of a person dying at a given age is random. But the <em>probability</em> that this happens is assumed to be fixed and determined by genes and genes alone.</p>\n\n<p>Now they simulate different kinds of twins. To simulate identical twins, they just draw parameters from their parameter distribution, assign those parameters to two different people, and then let them randomly die according to their death equation. (Is this getting morbid?) To simulate fraternal twins, they do the same thing, except instead of giving the two twins identical parameters, they give them <em>correlated</em> parameters, to reflect that they share 50% of their DNA.</p>\n\n<p>How exactly do they create those correlated parameters? They don’t explain this in the paper, and they’re quite vague in the supplement. As far as I can tell they sample two sets of parameters from their parameter distribution such that the <em>parameters</em> are correlated at a level of 0.5.</p>\n\n<p>Now they have simulated twins. They can simulate them with different extrinsic mortality values. If they lower extrinsic mortality, heritability of lifespan goes up. If they lower it to zero, heritability goes up to around 50%.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"more-commentary\">More commentary</h2>\n\n<p>Almost all human traits are partly genetic and partly due to the environment and/or random. If you could change the world and reduce the amount of randomness, then <em>of course</em> heritability would go up. That’s true for life expectancy just life for anything else. So what’s the point of this paper?</p>\n\n<p>There is a point!</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Sure, obviously heritability would be higher in a world without accidents or murder. We don’t need a paper to know that. But <em>how much</em> higher? It’s impossible to say without modeling and simulating that other world.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Our twin datasets are really old. It’s likely that non-aging-related deaths are lower now in the past, because we have better healthcare and so on. This means that the heritability of lifespan for people alive today may be larger than it was for the people in our twin datasets, some of whom were born in 1870. We won’t know for sure until we’re all dead, but this paper gives us a way to guess.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Have I mentioned that heritability depends on society? And that heritability changes when society changes? And that heritability is <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/heritable/\">just a ratio</a> and you should stop trying to make it be a non-ratio because only-ratio things cannot be non-ratios? This is a nice reminder.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Honestly, I think the model the paper built is quite clever. Nothing is perfect, but I think this is a pretty good run at the question of “how high would the heritability of lifespan be if extrinsic mortality were lower.</p>\n\n<p>I only have two objections. The first is to the Science writing style. This is a paper describing a statistical model. So shouldn’t there be somewhere in the paper where they explain exactly what they did, in order, from start to finish? Ostensibly, I think this is done in the left-hand column on the second page, just with little detail because Science is written for a general audience. But personally I think that description is the worst of all worlds. Instead of giving the high-level story in a coherent way, it throws random technical details at you without enough information to actually make sense of them. Couldn’t the full story with the full details at least be in the appendix? I feel like this wasted hours of my time, and that if someone wanted to reproduce this work, they would have almost no chance of doing so from the description given. How have we as a society decided that we should take our “best” papers and do this to them?</p>\n\n<p>But my main objection is this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/lifespan/title-box.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>At first, I thought this was absurd. The fact that people die in car accidents is not a “confounding factor”. And pretending that no one dies in a car accidents does not “address” some kind of bias. That’s just computing heritability in some other world. Remember, heritability is not some kind of Platonic form. It is an <em>observational statistic</em>. There is no such thing as “true” heritability, independent of the contingent facts of our world.\nBut upon reflection, I think they’re trying to say something like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heritability of intrinsic human lifespan is about 50% when extrinsic mortality is adjusted to be closer to modern levels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem is: I think this is… not true? Here are the actual heritability estimates in the paper, varying by dataset (different plots) the cutoff year (colors) and extrinsic mortality (x-axis).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/lifespan/full.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>When extrinsic mortality goes down, heritability goes up. So the obvious question is: What is extrinsic mortality in modern people?</p>\n\n<p>This is a tricky question, because “extrinsic mortality” isn’t some simple observational statistic. It is a parameter in their model. (Remember, they never looked at causes of death.) So it’s hard to say, but they seem to suggest that extrinsic mortality in modern people is 0.001 / year, or perhaps a bit less.</p>\n\n<p>The above figures have the base-10 logarithm of extrinsic mortality on the x-axis. And the base-10 logarithm of 0.001 is -3. But if you look at the curves when the x-axis is -3, the heritability estimates <em>are not 50%</em>. They’re more like 35-45%, depending on the particular model and age cutoff.</p>\n\n<p>So here’s my suggested title:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heritability of intrinsic human lifespan is about 40% when extrinsic mortality is adjusted to modern levels, according to our simulation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There might be a reason I don’t work at Science.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Suppose I give you a big number <em>F</em> and claim that <em>F</em> is a Fibonacci number. How could you confirm this?</p>\n<p>Before I go further, let me say what this post is really about. It&#8217;s not about Fibonacci numbers so much as it is about proofs and certificates. There&#8217;s no market for large Fibonacci numbers, and certainly no need to quickly verify that a number is a Fibonacci number.</p>\n<p>You could write a program to generate Fibonacci numbers, and run it until it either produces <em>F</em> , in which case you know <em>F</em> is a Fibonacci number, or the program produces a larger number than <em>F</em> without having produced <em>F</em>, in which case you know it&#8217;s not a Fibonacci number. But there&#8217;s a faster way.</p>\n<p>A certificate is data that allows you to confirm a solution to a problem in less time, usually far less time, than it took to generate the solution. For example, <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/01/03/pratt-certificate/\">Pratt certificates</a> give you a way to prove that a number is prime. For a large prime, you could verify its Pratt certificate much faster than directly trying to prove the number is prime.</p>\n<p>There is a theorem that says a number <em>f</em> is a Fibonacci number if and only if one of 5<em>f</em><sup>2</sup> ± 4 is a perfect square. So in addition to <em>F</em> another number <em>r</em> that is a certificate that <em>F</em> is a Fibonacci number. You compute</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>N</em> = 5<em>F</em>² − <em>r</em>²</p>\n<p>and if <em>N</em> is equal to 4 or −4, you know that <em>F</em> is a Fibonacci number. Otherwise it is not.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a small example. Suppose I give you (12586269025, 28143753123) and claim that the first number is a Fibonacci number and the second number is its certificate.

    "content": "<p>On 22 December 2024, <a href=\"/2024/12/llm-from-scratch-1\">I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Over the Christmas break (and probably beyond) I'm planning to work through\n  <a href=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/\">Sebastian Raschka</a>'s book\n  \"<a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch\">Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)</a>\".\n  I'm expecting to get through a chapter or less a day, in order to give things\n  time to percolate properly.  Each day, or perhaps each chapter, I'll post here\n  about anything I find particularly interesting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More than ten months and 26 blog posts later, I've reached the end of the main\nbody of the book -- there's just the appendices to go.\nEven allowing for the hedging, my optimism was adorable.</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to put anyone else off the book by saying that, though!  I expect most people\nwill get through it much faster.  I made a deliberate decision at the start to write up\neverything I learned as I worked through it, and that, I think, has helped me solidify\nthings in my mind much better than I would have done if I'd only been reading it and doing\nthe exercises.  But on the other hand, writing things up does take a <em>lot</em> of time,\nmuch more than the actual learning does.  It's worth it for me, but probably isn't\nfor everyone.</p>\n\n<p>So, what next?  I've finished the main body of the book, and built up a decent backlog\nas I did so.  What do I need to do before I can treat my \"LLM from scratch\" journey as done?\nAnd what other ideas have come up while I worked through it that might be good bases for\nfuture, similar series?</p>\n<p>There are a few sources of ideas for this -- from the book itself and its supplementary\nmaterial, from notes I've made as I went along, and from other things that I've kept on\na mental checklist.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-appendices-and-supplementary-material\">The appendices and supplementary material</h3>\n\n<p>There are five appendices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A: An introduction to PyTorch</li>\n<li>B: References and further reading</li>\n<li>C: Exercise solutions</li>\n<li>D: Adding bells and whistles to the training loop</li>\n<li>E: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Raschka also gives a link at the end of chapter 7 to a notebook showing how to do\nfurther fine tuning using <a href=\"https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch07/04_preference-tuning-with-dpo\">Direct Preference Optimization</a>,\nwhich also looks fascinating, and he's working on a new project,\n\"<a href=\"https://github.com/rasbt/reasoning-from-scratch\">Build a reasoning model (from scratch)</a>\".</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"things-ive-deferred-myself\">Things I've deferred myself</h3>\n\n<p>While working through the book, I've deliberately deferred various\nthings.  I'd kind of lost track of all of them, so I gave ChatGPT the source\nmarkdown for all of the posts in this series, and asked it to find where I'd done that.\nIt did an amazing job!  There were three categories: long context and attention efficiency,\nmaths, and optimisers.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"long-context-and-attention-efficiency\">Long context and attention efficiency.</h4>\n\n<p>The model we've built in the book has\na context length of 1,024 tokens, and is <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x00028;</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x00029;</mo></mrow></math> in both space and time\nwith respect to the number of tokens you feed it.  There are lots of things that\npeople do to work around that.  Things I need to learn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The KV cache</strong>.  This is basic stuff and I feel I sorta-kinda understand it, but\nI haven't written about it so I can't be sure.  It's a pretty obvious enhancement\nto avoid repeating work when generating autoregressively -- that is, the normal\nsetup where in order to generate <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></math> tokens, we give the model its input,\nsample our first token from its predictions, then feed the whole thing -- the input\nand that first token -- back in for the second token, and so on.  Obviously,\nbecause attention is causal, we're doing exactly the same work every time for\nall of the tokens in each round apart from the last one, so it makes sense\nto cache things.  The result is that generating the first token is still <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x00028;</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x00029;</mo></mrow></math>, but\nsubsequent ones will be something more like <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x00028;</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">&#x00029;</mo></mrow></math> each.  That's why real-world modern models tend to take\na while pondering before they generate the first token but then speed up -- they\nneed to fill their cache.</li>\n<li><strong>FlashAttention</strong> and related things: there are lots of ways people have found to reduce the cost of\nattention generally, but this seems to be the most popular one, or at least the best\nto get started with.</li>\n<li><strong>Better positional embeddings</strong>: the context length of our GPT-2-style LLM is fixed\nin part because you need position embeddings for every possible input position.\nThat means that we can never extend it.  More modern LLMs use better ways to\nrepresent positions -- Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) look like they're\nvery popular.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"maths\">Maths</h4>\n\n<p>I really want to understand softmax at a better level than \"it's a magic thing\nthat turns logits into probabilities\".  I'd also like to learn more about higher-order\ntensor operations -- the ones that we use in the book are essentially treating\nthe extra dimensions as the batch, but I believe that there's more to it than that.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"optimisers\">Optimisers</h4>\n\n<p>I really want to understand in reasonable depth what optimisers do.  I know that\nthey make gradient updates work better than they do with simple gradient descent.\nBut how?</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>That was the set of things I noted at the time I wrote the posts so far, but there are a few more that\ncome to mind as I write this.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"automatic-differentiation-and-the-backward-pass\">Automatic differentiation and the backward pass</h3>\n\n<p>In some comments that he made on posts in this series, <code>Simon</code> said that it seems like this book\nisn't really \"from scratch\", given that we rely on PyTorch's magic to handle the\nbackward pass.</p>\n\n<p>He's 100% right!  I think I understand why it is that way, though.\nThere would be two different ways that I can see for the book to do it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Manually code a backward pass to go with the forward pass on each of our modules.\nSimon did this, and was kind enough to share his code with me -- it looks like one of those\nthings (like attention) that is pretty hard to get your head around initially, but\nonce it clicks it's super-clear.  Definitely kudos to him for getting it all to work!\nThe problem with this is that I don't think any\nML practitioners do this nowadays, because automatic differentiation\nis there in every popular framework.  So it might be a good learning experience,\nbut also might nudge people into an unprofitable direction.</li>\n<li>Create our own automatic differentiation system.  Andrej Karpathy pops up again\nwhen looking into this; he created <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd\">micrograd</a>,\nwhich handles back-propagation for scalar functions.  That's really clever -- but\nit would be hard, and a bit of a side quest from the point of the book.  Also,\nthe most interesting stuff (at least from what little I know) for automatic\ndifferentiation is how you do it with non-scalars -- the matrices and higher-order\ntensors that our LLM uses.  From what Simon says, this is where you need to use\nthe mysterious Jacobian matrices I've heard about in the context of back-propagation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think I'd definitely like to revisit that at some point.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tokenisers\">Tokenisers</h3>\n\n<p>Another one from Simon; while the book does explain how tokenisers work, even down\nto a high-level overview of byte-pair encoding, we don't write our own.  Again, I can\nsee why this is -- we load in the GPT-2 weights, so we need to use that model's tokeniser.\nAnd there's no point in writing our own if we're just going to throw it away.</p>\n\n<p>But perhaps a bit of time playing with one would be useful?</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"trying-to-train-the-llm-as-a-base-model\">Trying to train the LLM as a base model</h4>\n\n<p>The book, quite reasonably, shows you how to train your LLM, does a basic train\non a small dataset, and then we switch to downloading the \"pre-cooked\" weights\nfrom OpenAI.  That makes sense given that not every reader will have access to enough\nhardware to really train from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>But given that I was getting a pretty good training speed on my own hardware, perhaps\nI could train a model really from scratch, perhaps using one of the smaller\n<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb\">FineWeb</a> datasets?  Even if\nI can't do it locally, perhaps it might be doable on a rented cloud machine, like\nthe Lambda Labs ones I used when <a href=\"/fine-tuning\">fine-tuning Llama 3</a>?</p>\n\n<p>After all, Andrej Karpathy is training <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1\">a full model that you can chat with for\n$100</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"building-an-llm-from-scratch-on-my-own\">Building an LLM from scratch on my own.</h3>\n\n<p>I don't think I ever mentioned this on the blog, but one important plan for me is to\ntry to build an LLM from scratch, only using my own blog posts and what I remember --\nno looking at the book.  If I can do that, then I can be reasonably sure that I really\nhave learned it all.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also thinking that I'll do that using a different library -- that is, not PyTorch.\nThat would stop me from regurgitating code that I've learned.  If you're reading this\nwithin a day or so of the post's publication, I'm\n<a href=\"https://x.com/gpjt/status/1985434030880293004\">running a poll on X/Twitter about which framework to use</a>.\nIf you have an opinion, please do stop by and vote :-)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mixture-of-experts\">Mixture-of-experts</h3>\n\n<p>It feels like almost every new model these days is an MoE.  I have read a lot around the\nsubject and would love to build on it.  Essentially, instead of having just one feed-forward network\nafter your attention heads, you have several.  In front of them you have a router -- a trainable\nnetwork of some kind -- that tells you which of these \"expert\" FFNs the token should be\nforwarded to.  You then send it to the top (or top <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow></math>) experts, while leaving the others\ninactive.  The result is that you have more space (in terms of parameters) for the LLM\nto know about things, but not all of those parameters are active during inference -- so\nyour model is smarter but still fast.</p>\n\n<p>There's a bunch of interesting stuff there, from how you build it in the first place,\nto how you handle the fact that you're processing lots of tokens at once -- multiple\ntokens in each sequence and multiple sequences in a batch.</p>\n\n<p>It would be a pretty cool follow-on to the \"my own LLM\" series, thinking about it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"so-what-next\">So, what next?</h3>\n\n<p>I definitely don't think I need to do all of those things in order to wrap up\nthis series.  Here's the subset I'm planning on doing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Training the full GPT-2 base model myself.  I'm 100% going to try this.</li>\n<li>From the appendices -- anything that surprises me from the one on PyTorch, and\nperhaps from the \"bells and whistles\" in the training loop.  The others I either\nwon't do, or will pick up later.</li>\n<li>Building my own LLM from scratch in a different framework, without using the book.\nThat is, I think, essential, and perhaps would be the crowning post of this series.\nIt would be a nice way to end it, wouldn't it?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the other things, I think there are some potential future series to write.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Improving context length -- RoPE and other tricks --\nsounds like an excellent series to start on when I'm done with this.  AIs tell\nme that other interesting things to look into would be ALiBi, NTK/YaRN scaling, and positional interpolation.</li>\n<li>Improving performance: the KV cache, FlashAttention, and other performance enhancements\nlikewise feel like they could make a good series.</li>\n<li>I also want to do a separate series on LoRA.  In that, I'll draw on appendix E from\nthis book, but also on other tutorials.</li>\n<li>Likewise DPO, along with other post-training that can be done to make models more\nuseful as chatbots, like Reinforcement Learning.   I'd really like to spend some\ntime understanding that area.  (And Raschka's upcoming reasoning model book might\nfit into that category too.)</li>\n<li>Optimisers: Adam, AdamW, maybe Muon (though the latter scares me a bit).</li>\n<li>The maths -- softmax and higher-order tensor calculations -- also seems to belong\nin another series, perhaps an extension of the various \"maths for AI\" posts I've\ndone in the past.</li>\n<li>Automatic differentiation and the backward pass; that would make a great series.</li>\n<li>A mixture-of-experts model would be excellent fun, I think.</li>\n<li>Tokenisers would be a great stand-alone post, at least at the level that I can\nsee myself covering it.  Perhaps that would develop into a series if I found\nmyself getting sucked in.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm certainly not promising that I'll write up all (or even any) of that second list, but they\nall seem really tempting to me right now.  If you're particularly interested in seeing\nmy take on any of them, please do leave a comment below.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"coming-up\">Coming up...</h3>\n\n<p>I think the next post in this series -- maybe the next several posts -- will be on\ntrying to train the model code provided in the book from scratch to produce my own\nbase model.  Stay tuned!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/2025/12/llm-from-scratch-28-training-a-base-model-from-scratch\">Here's a link to the next post in this series</a>.</p>\n",

The most mind-numbingly boring people I know are working overtime to seem interesting: curating their book recommendations, workshopping their opinions to be provocative but not too provocative. </p><p>The effort is palpable. And the effort is exactly what makes them forgettable.</p><p>I&apos;ve come to believe that boring = personality edited down to nothing. Somewhere along the way, too many of us learned to sand off our weird edges, to preemptively remove anything that might make someone uncomfortable or make us seem difficult to be around.</p><p>And the result = boredom.</p><h2 id=\"youve-been-editing-yourself\">You&apos;ve been editing yourself</h2><p>Erving Goffman wrote in 1959 about how we all perform versions of ourselves depending on context. What&apos;s less normal is when the performance becomes the only thing left. When you&apos;ve been editing yourself for so long that you&apos;ve forgotten what the original draft looked like.</p><p>This happens gradually. In middle school, you learn that certain enthusiasms are embarrassing. In high school, you learn which opinions are acceptable in your social group. In college, you refine your persona further. By the time you&apos;re an adult, you&apos;ve become so skilled at reading rooms and ajusting accordingly that you don&apos;t even notice you&apos;re doing it. You&apos;ve automated your own inauthenticity.</p><p>This process feels like maturity, or it feels the way we think maturity ought to feel. It feels like growing up and becoming an adult or a professional. And in some sense, I suppose it is. But there&apos;s a difference between reading a room and erasing yourself to fit into it. Reading a room is social intelligence. Erasing yourself to fit into it is something else.</p><p>I can always tell when I&apos;m talking to someone who&apos;s been over-edited. They have opinions, but the opinions are suspiciously well-calibrated. They have interests, but the interests are respectable. They never say anything that makes me uncomfortable or surprised. They&apos;re like a movie that&apos;s been focus-grouped into mediocrity: technically competent and forgettable.</p><h2 id=\"audit-what-youve-hidden\">Audit what you&apos;ve hidden</h2><p>Make a list of everything you&apos;ve stopped saying or admitting to because you worried it was embarrassing. The band you used to love until someone made fun of it. The hobby you dropped because it wasn&apos;t sophisticated enough. The opinion you stopped voicing because people looked at you weird.</p><p>Most people&apos;s cringe lists are surprisingly long. And most of the items on those lists aren&apos;t actually embarrassing in any objective sense. They&apos;re just things that didn&apos;t fit the persona you decided you needed to maintain.</p><p>I stopped telling people I loved pop punk for half a decade. I hadn&apos;t stopped loving it, but I&apos;d learned that pop punk was supposed to be embarrassing, and I wanted to seem cool, or at least not uncool. Almost everyone I know has some version of this story: the authentic enthusiasm they buried because it didn&apos;t fit.</p><p>The things on your cringe list are probably the most interesting things about you. They&apos;re the parts of your personality that survived despite the editing. The fact that you still feel something about them, even if that something is embarrassment, means they&apos;re still alive in there somewhere.</p><h2 id=\"get-it-back\">Get it back</h2><p>The weird parts are never as weird as you think. Or rather, they&apos;re weird in ways that make you memorable. Being the person who&apos;s really into competitive puzzle-solving or birdwatching gives people somthing to remember. Being the person who&apos;s vaguely interested in the same five acceptable topics as everyone else gives them nothing.</p><p>The recovery protocol is simple. Start saying the thing you would normally edit out. Mention the embarrassing enthusiasm. Voice the opinion that might not land well. Do this in low-stakes situations first: with close friends, with strangers you&apos;ll never see again. Notice that the world doesn&apos;t end. Notice that some people respond positively to the unedited version, even if others don&apos;t.</p><p>The people who respond negatively aren&apos;t your people anyway. That&apos;s the benefit of being unedited: it filters your social world. The more you hide who you actually are, the more you attract people who like the persona, which means the more alone you feel even when surrounded by friends.</p><h2 id=\"be-polarizing\">Be polarizing</h2><p>The most memorable people are polarizing. Some people love them; some people find them insufferable. That&apos;s what having an actual personality looks like from the outside. If everyone has a mild positive reaction to you, you&apos;ve probably sanded youself down into a carefully constructed average of what you think people want.</p><p>Christopher Hitchens was polarizing. So was Julia Child. So is anyone you can actually remember meeting. But provocation for its own sake is another form of performance; what actually matters is that you stop preemptively removing the parts of yourself that might provoke a reaction.</p><p>Some people are going to dislike you.</p><p>They&apos;re allowed to.</p><p>That&apos;s the price of being someone worth remembering.</p>",
