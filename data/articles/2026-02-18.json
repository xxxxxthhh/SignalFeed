Claude Code <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/pull/65\">did most of the work</a> - the new models had a fiddly amount of extra details around adaptive thinking and no longer supporting prefixes, as described <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide\">in Anthropic's migration guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/b185576a95e9321b441f0a4dfc0e297c\">what I got</a> from:</p>\n<pre><code>uvx --with llm-anthropic llm 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -m claude-sonnet-4.6\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"The pelican has a jaunty top hat with a red band.

    "content": "\n<p>Hartley Charlton, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple invited select members of the media to the event in three\nmajor cities around the world. It is simply described as a\n“special Apple Experience,” and there is no further information\nabout what it may entail. The invitation features a 3D Apple logo\ndesign composed of yellow, green, and blue discs.</p>\n\n<p>It is notable that Apple is specifically using the word\n“experience,” rather than “event.” Unlike a full live-streamed\nevent from Apple Park, the March 4 event in other cities is likely\nto be smaller in scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Among the products expected soon — either by annual schedule predictability, or via the rumor mill — are the iPhone 17e, an updated iPad Air (going from the M3 to M4), an updated base-model iPad (going from A16 to A18), updated MacBook Pros with the M5 Pro and Max, updated MacBook Airs (going from M4 to M5 — the M4 models were <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-introduces-the-new-macbook-air-with-the-m4-chip-and-a-sky-blue-color/\">released in early March last year</a>), and, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27\">per Gurman</a>, the long-rumored new lower-cost MacBook with an A18 chip (a “MacBook e”, if you will, although I certainly don’t think that will be the name — my guess is Apple will just call it “MacBook” without an adjective).</p>\n\n<p>What strikes me is that March 4 — the “experience” day — is a Wednesday. So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the “experience” will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos. Spread the announcements out across a few days, but then have in-person events for members of the media to get a hands-on experience with all of them, station-by-station, without needing to produce an Apple Event keynote film.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple Invites Media to Special ‘Experience’ in New York, London, and Shanghai on March 4’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/17/apple-special-experience-march-4\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t",

    "content": "<p>The good folks at Epomaker know that I love an ergonomic keyboard, so they've sent me their new \"Split 70\" model to review.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't your traditional ergonomic keyboard. Essentially, this is two separate halves joined by a USB-C cable; so you can position it however you like.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/split70.webp\" alt=\"A keyboard split in two.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"388\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67791\">\n\n<p>Here's a quick video showing it in action:</p>\n\n<p></p><div style=\"width: 620px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-67570-2\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/split-new.mp4?_=2\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/split-new.mp4\">https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/split-new.mp4</a></video></div><p></p>\n\n<p>It is <em>very</em> clicky! Yes, you can replace the keys and switches with something softer. But then people wouldn't know you're the sort of nerd who uses a mechanical keyboard. And where's the fun in that?!</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the lights are delightfully dazzly. Yes, you can make them more subtle or even turn them off. But then people wouldn't know you're the sort of cool kid who has a light-up keyboard.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"linux-compatibility\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#linux-compatibility\">Linux Compatibility</a></h2>\n\n<p>The Split 70 comes with a USB-C to A cable. Personally, I'd've preferred straight C-C, but this does the job. Flick the switch at the back to USB mode, plug it in, and Linux instantly detected it. No drivers to configure.</p>\n\n<p>It shows up as <code>342d:e491 HS Epomaker Split 70</code> - there's another switch for changing between Mac and PC mode. That doesn't change how the keyboard presents itself; just the keycodes it sends.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a Bluetooth option. Again, Linux use was a breeze - although you'll have to remember what the pairing combo is and which device it is paired to.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a 2.4GHz option. Hidden on the back of the left unit is a little USB-A receiver. Again, pairing is simple - just plug it in and flick the switch.</p>\n\n<p>As expected, it also plays well with Android. The Bluetooth connection worked as did USB-OTG. Of course, quite <em>why</em> you'd want a giant heavy keyboard paired to your tiny phone is an exercise left to the reader.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customisation\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#customisation\">Customisation</a></h2>\n\n<p>This came as a US keyboard with the \" and @ in the \"wrong\" place. It's easy to remap the keys and adjust the lights using <a href=\"https://usevia.app/\">https://usevia.app/</a> - although you'll need to <a href=\"https://epomaker.com/blogs/via-json/epomaker-split70-json\">download the JSON layout first</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It comes with a tool to remove the keys and switches. I'll admit, I'm too much of a chicken to attempt that - but it does <em>look</em> easy.</p>\n\n<p>What <em>doesn't</em> look easy is the way to get it into firmware update mode - which involves shorting some pins and comes with some stringent warnings!</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/firmware.webp\" alt=\" HOW TO ENTER DFU (FIRMWARE UPDATE) MODE Left Half (with knob): 1. Disconnect all cables from the keyboard. 2. Hold ESC and plug in USB-C. 3. &quot;Device Connected&quot; shows on the QMK Toolbox Right Half (with arrow keys): 1. Disconnect all cables from the keyboard. 2. Remove ALT and FN Keycaps and Flip the toggle switch between them down. 3. Remove Right Spacebar keycap and switch, short-circuit PCB holes with tweezers, then plug in USB-C.  4. &quot;Device Connected&quot; shows on the QMK Toolbox 5. After flashing, flip ALT/FN toggle back up. @ Please reset the keyboard after flashing is completed. *Notes: 1. When updating or flashing the keyboard, MAKE SURE ONLY ONE KEYBOARD IS CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE! 2. When updating or flashing the keyboard, DON'T MOVE THE KEYBOARD or PRESS ANY KEYS!\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1183\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67792\">\n\n<h2 id=\"gpl\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#gpl\">GPL</a></h2>\n\n<p>There is some question about whether Epomaker comply with the GPL when it comes to the <a href=\"https://docs.qmk.fm/license_violations\">QMK source</a>. They appear to have <a href=\"https://github.com/Epomaker?tab=repositories\">some source code available</a> but it is hard to tell whether it exists for this specific model.</p>\n\n<p>After politely emailing them about GPL compliance, they were happy to supply <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Epomaker-Split70-QMK-File.zip\">a link to the Split 70's QMK source code</a>. I'm not deep into recompiling the firmware for my keyboards - but it looked comprehensive to me.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"using-it\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#using-it\">Using it</a></h2>\n\n<p>It's delightful to type on - and I got used to the noise after a while. I wasn't a massive fan of the layout to start with, but it easy to see its appeal. Personally, I'd like an extra numpad to go with it.</p>\n\n<p>The four macro keys are useful. By default, they're set to cut, copy, paste, and undo - but can easily be remapped. The knob is fun - by default it does volume, I'm sure you can find something else useful to do with it.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life is excellent even if you have the lights on full disco. I kept it plugged in to my machine for typing most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to adjust the split to your own specification is outstanding. If you suffer from RSI, this can genuinely help.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"price\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/gadget-review-epomaker-split-70-mechanical-keyboard/#price\">Price</a></h2>\n\n<p>About £80 from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NMYqDr\">Amazon UK</a> or <a href=\"https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3gTT3r9\">AliExpress</a>. That feels <em>reasonable</em> for this much tech. Obviously you can get a bog-standard keyboard for buttons - but this is unique, tactile, and interesting.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>As a product is nearing release, the release management selects a build and declares it to be the <i>escrow build</i>. The metaphor is that this build has been placed into the hands of an imaginary third party for eventual release to customers provided certain requirements are met.</p>\n<p>Those requirements are that the product survive a period of concerted testing and self-host usage to build confidence that it meets its quality and reliability targets. The Developer Division Release Team blog unhelpfully described escrow as &#8220;<a title=\"Whidbey RTM Escrow\" href=\"&#96;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/release_team/whidbey-rtm-escrow\">the phase before the completion of the RTM milestone where the product goes through a period of bake time</a>.&#8221; I say <i>unhelpfully</i> because it defines one Microspeak term (<i>escrow</i>) in terms of another Microspeak term (<i>bake time</i>). Some time ago, <a title=\"That's just super (and a note on baking)\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060213-09/?p=32313\"> I defined the Microspeak term <i>bake</i></a> as &#8220;(of a code change) to build confidence by observing its behavior over a period of time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Putting this all together, a more complete definition of <i>escrow</i> would be &#8220;the phase before the completion of the RTM milestone where the product accepts no changes while its behavior is closely observed to ensure that it meets release criteria.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When a problem is found, the release team has to assess whether this problem is significant enough to require a product change. This assessment is a balance of many factors: How often does it occur? Does it affect one category of user more than another? How severe are the consequences? How easily can it be worked around? These criteria are typically¹ formalized by a <a title=\"Does it meet the bar?\" href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/virtual_pc_guy/does-it-meet-the-bar\"> bug bar</a>.</p>\n<p>If a severe enough bug is discovered, then an <i>escrow reset</i> is declared, and the bug fix is accepted,² a new build is produced, the new build is declared the new <i>escrow</i> build, and the cycle repeats.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the product makes it through the escrow period without any escrow reset events, and the escrow build is released to manufacturing.</p>\n<p>¹ <a title=\"When you use a term, it helps if you know what the term means\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100609-00/?p=13763\"> Though not always</a>, apparently.</p>\n<p>² Plus <a title=\"Losing the game of Last Checkin Chicken two products in a row\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080226-00/?p=23323\"> any bug fixes that were granted &#8220;opportunistic&#8221; status</a> by the release management team.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260217-00/?p=112067\">Microspeak: Escrow</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing\">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>\n",

href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/cognitive-bias/2025-kelly.pdf\">new paper</a> finds a different story in the archives of the lead author, Leon Festinger. Up to half of the attendees at cult meetings may have been undercover researchers. One of them became a leader in the cult and encouraged other members to make statements that would look good in the book. After the failed prediction, rather than doubling down, some of the cultists walked back their statements or left altogether.</p><p>Between this, the <a href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/i/178108059/18-dissonance-about-dissonance\">impossible numbers in the original laboratory study of cognitive dissonance</a>, and a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/25152459231213375\">recent failure to replicate a basic dissonance effect</a>, things aren&#8217;t looking great for the phenomenon.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> But that only makes me believe in it harder!</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>(2) THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT AND A LIE FOR THE TRUTH</strong></h1><p>Another classic sadly struck from the canon of behavioral/brain sciences: the neurologist Oliver Sacks appears to have <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/12/15/oliver-sacks-put-himself-into-his-case-studies-what-was-the-cost\">greatly embellished or even invented his case studies</a>. In a letter to his brother, Sacks described his blockbuster <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat </em>as a book of &#8220;fairy tales [...] half-report, half-imagined, half-science, half-fable&#8221;.</p><p>This is exactly how the <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/mjhnp_v1\">Stanford Prison Experiment</a> and the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0957154X221150878\">Rosenhan experiment</a> got debunked&#8212;someone started rooting around in the archives and found a bunch of damning notes. I&#8217;m confused: back in the day, why was everybody meticulously documenting their research malfeasance?</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>(3) A SMASH HIT</strong></h1><p>If you ever took PSY 101, you&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href=\"https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/S0022-5371(74)80011-3\">this study from 1974</a>. You show people a video of a car crash, and then you ask them to estimate how fast the cars were going, and their answer depends on what verb you use. For example, if you ask &#8220;How fast were the cars going when they <em>smashed</em> into each other?&#8221; people give higher speed estimates than if you ask, &#8220;How fast were the cars going when they <em>hit</em> each other?&#8221; (Emphasis mine). This study has been cited nearly <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1177025544043488986&amp;as_sdt=400005&amp;sciodt=0,14&amp;hl=en\">4,000 times</a>, and its first author became a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/how-elizabeth-loftus-changed-the-meaning-of-memory\">much sought-after expert witness</a> who testifies about the faultiness of memory.</p><p>A blogger named Croissanthology re-ran the study with nearly 10x as many participants (446 vs. 45 in the original). The effect <a href=\"https://x.com/croissanthology/status/1985941107189166430\">did not replicate</a>. No replication is perfect, but no original study is either. And remember, this kind of effect is supposed to be so robust and generalizable that we can deploy it in court.</p><p>I think the underlying point of this research is still correct: memory is reconstructed, not simply recalled, so what we remember is not exactly what we saw. But our memories are not so fragile that a single word can overwrite them. Otherwise, if you ever got pulled over for speeding, you could just be like, &#8220;Officer, how fast was I going when my car <em>crawled past </em>you?&#8221;</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>(4) CHOICE UNDERLOAD</strong></h1><p>In <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/386588\">one study from 1995</a>, physicians who were shown multiple treatment options were more likely to recommend no treatment at all. The researchers thought this was a &#8220;choice overload&#8221; effect, like &#8220;ahhh there&#8217;s too many choices, so I&#8217;ll just choose nothing at all&#8221;. In contrast, <a href=\"https://www.jasoncollins.blog/posts/more-options-more-action-contradicting-a-classic-finding?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">a new study from 2025</a> found that when physicians were shown multiple treatment options, they were somewhat <em>more </em>likely to recommend a treatment.</p><p>I think &#8220;choice overload&#8221; is like many effects we discover in psychology: <em>can </em>it happen? Yes. Can the opposite also happen? Also yes. When does it go one way, and when does it go the other? Ahhh you&#8217;re showing me too many options I don&#8217;t know.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>(5) THE TALE OF THE TWO-INCH DOG</strong></h1><p>Okay, enough dumping on other people&#8217;s research. It&#8217;s my turn in the hot seat.</p><p>In 2022, my colleague Jason Dana and I published a paper showing that <a href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/p/youre-probably-wrong-about-how-things\">people don&#8217;t know how public opinion has changed</a>.

href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/398288189_The_accuracy_of_gist_Rethinking_public_awareness_of_attitude_change\">new paper</a> by Irina Vartanova, Kimmo Eriksson, and Pontus Strimling reanalyzes our data and finds that actually, people are <em>great </em>at knowing how public opinion has changed.</p><p>What gives? We come to different conclusions because we ask different questions. Jason and I ask, &#8220;When people estimate change, how <em>far off</em> are they from the right answer?&#8221; Vartanova et al. ask, &#8220;Are people&#8217;s estimates <em>correlated</em> with the right answer?&#8221; These approaches seem like they should give you the same results, but they don&#8217;t, and I&#8217;ll show you why.</p><p>Imagine you ask people to estimate the size of a house, a dog, and a stapler. Vartanova&#8217;s correlation approach would say: &#8220;People know that a house is bigger than a dog, and that a dog is bigger than a stapler. Therefore, people are good at estimating the sizes of things.&#8221; Our approach would say: &#8220;People think a house is three miles long, a dog is two inches, and a stapler is 1.5 centimeters. Therefore, people are <em>not good</em> at estimating the sizes of things.&#8221;</p><p>I think our approach is the right one, for two reasons. First, ours is more useful. As the name implies, a correlation can only tell you about the relationships between things. So it can&#8217;t tell you whether people are good at estimating the size of a house. It can only tell you whether people think houses are <em>bigger than dogs</em>.</p><p>Second, I think our approach is much closer to the way people actually make these judgments in their lives. If I asked you to estimate the size of a house, you wouldn&#8217;t spontaneously be like, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s bigger than a dog.&#8221; You&#8217;d just eyeball it. I think people do the same thing with public opinion&#8212;they eyeball it based on headlines they see, conversations they have, and vibes they remember. If I asked you, &#8220;How have attitudes toward gun control changed?&#8221; you wouldn&#8217;t be like, &#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve changed more than attitudes toward gender equality.&#8221;<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>While these reanalyses don&#8217;t shift my opinion, I&#8217;m glad people are looking into shifts in opinions at all, and that they found our data interesting enough to dig into.</p><div><hr></div><h1>(6) Let&#8217;s cleanse the palate.

spiders every year in your sleep&#8221;, and back then, we just had to believe whatever we heard. </p><p>Post-internet, anyone can quickly discover that this &#8220;fact&#8221; was actually a <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/swallow-spiders/\">deliberate lie spread by a journalist named Lisa Birgit Holst</a>. Holst included the &#8220;eight spiders&#8221; myth in a 1993 article in a magazine called <em>PC Insider</em>, using it as an example of exactly the kind of hogwash that spreads easily online.</p><p>That is, anyway, what most sources will tell you. But if you dig a little deeper, you&#8217;ll discover that the whole story about Lisa Birgit Holst is <em>also made up</em>. &#8220;Lisa Birgit Holst&#8221; is an anagram of &#8220;This is a big troll&#8221;; the founder of Snopes <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/lisa-birgit-holst/\">claims he came up with it in his younger and wilder days</a>. The true origin of the spiders myth remains unknown.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>(11) I&#8217;D LIKE TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER 19 TIMES A DAY</strong></h1><p>In 2015, Reagan National Airport in DC received 8,760 noise complaints; 6,852 of those complaints (78%) <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/dourado-airport-noise-mop-v1.pdf\">came from a single household</a>, meaning the people living there called to complain an average of 19 times a day. This seems to be common both across airports and across complaint systems in general: <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/the-tyranny-of-the-complainers.html\">the majority of gripes usually comes from a few prolific gripers</a>. Some of these systems are legally mandated to investigate every complaint, so this means a handful of psychotic people with telephones&#8212;or now, LLMs&#8212;can waste millions of dollars. I keep calling to complain about this, but nobody ever does anything about it.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>(12) BE THERE OR BE 11 SQUARES</strong></h1><p><span class=\"mention-wrap\"

know people will be like &#8220;there are hundreds of studies that confirm cognitive dissonance&#8221;. But if you look at that study that didn&#8217;t replicate, it had 10 participants per condition. That&#8217;s way too few to detect anything interesting&#8212;you need <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2205186\">46 men and 46 women</a> just to demonstrate the fact that men weigh more than women, on average. Many of those other cognitive dissonance studies have similarly tiny samples, so their existence doesn&#8217;t put me at ease. Plus, the theorizing here is so squishy that many different patterns of results could arguably confirm or disconfirm the theory: here&#8217;s someone arguing that, in fact, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/ericman.bsky.social/post/3m52mjdohwc2q\">the failure to replicate was actually a success</a>.</p><p>A<em> </em>reporter tracked down Elliot Aronson, a student of Festinger and a dissonance researcher himself, and posed the following question to him:</p><blockquote><p>I asked him how the theory could be falsified, since any choice a person made could be attributed to dissonance. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to disprove anything,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote><p>Very true, on many levels.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-2\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-2\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">2</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>There&#8217;s one more point where we disagree. Vartanova et al. point out that 70% of estimates are in the right <em>direction</em>&#8212;as in, if support for gun control went down, 70% of participants correctly guessed that it went down. The researchers look at that number and go, &#8220;That seems pretty good&#8221;. We look at the exact same number and go, &#8220;That seems pretty bad&#8221;. Obviously this is a judgment call, but getting the direction right is such a low bar that we think it&#8217;s remarkable so many people don&#8217;t clear it. Getting the direction of change wrong is a bit like saying that a dog is bigger than a house.</p></div></div>",
