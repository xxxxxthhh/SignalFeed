A big part of that is proving to ourselves and to other people that the code we are responsible for behaves as expected.</p>\n<p>This becomes even more important - and challenging - as we embrace coding agents as a core part of our software development process.</p>\n<p>The more code we churn out with agents, the more valuable tools are that reduce the amount of manual QA time we need to spend.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting things about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/\">the StrongDM software factory model</a> is how they ensure that their software is well tested and delivers value despite their policy that \"code must not be reviewed by humans\". Part of their solution involves expensive swarms of QA agents running through \"scenarios\" to exercise their software. It's fascinating, but I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on QA robots if I can avoid it!</p>\n<p>I need tools that allow agents to clearly demonstrate their work to me, while minimizing the opportunities for them to cheat about what they've done.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"showboat-agents-build-documents-to-demo-their-work\">Showboat: Agents build documents to demo their work</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat\">Showboat</a></strong> is the tool I built to help agents demonstrate their work to me.</p>\n<p>It's a CLI tool (a Go binary, optionally <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/distributing-go-binaries/\">wrapped in Python</a> to make it easier to install) that helps an agent construct a Markdown document demonstrating exactly what their newly developed code can do.</p>\n<p>It's not designed for humans to run, but here's how you would run it anyway:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>showboat init demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>How to use curl and jq<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Here's how to use curl and jq together.<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\nshowboat <span class=\"pl-c1\">exec</span> demo.md bash <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat note demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nshowboat image demo.md <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Here's what the result looks like if you open it up in VS Code and preview the Markdown:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/curl-demo.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot showing a Markdown file &quot;demo.md&quot; side-by-side with its rendered preview. The Markdown source (left) shows: &quot;# How to use curl and jq&quot;, italic timestamp &quot;2026-02-10T01:12:30Z&quot;, prose &quot;Here's how to use curl and jq together.&quot;, a bash code block with &quot;curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description&quot;, output block showing '&quot;CLI tool for interacting with the web&quot;', text &quot;And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:&quot;, a bash {image} code block with &quot;curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png &amp;&amp; echo curl-logo.png&quot;, and a Markdown image reference &quot;2056e48f-2026-02-10&quot;. The rendered preview (right) displays the formatted heading, timestamp, prose, styled code blocks, and the curl logo image in dark teal showing &quot;curl://&quot; with circuit-style design elements.\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" /></p>\n<p>Here's that <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/fb0b24696ed8dd91314fe41f4c453563#file-demo-md\">demo.md file in a Gist</a>.</p>\n<p>So a sequence of <code>showboat init</code>, <code>showboat note</code>, <code>showboat exec</code> and <code>showboat image</code> commands constructs a Markdown document one section at a time, with the output of those <code>exec</code> commands automatically added to the document directly following the commands that were run.</p>\n<p>The <code>image</code> command is a little special - it looks for a file path to an image in the output of the command and copies that image to the current folder and references it in the file.</p>\n<p>That's basically the whole thing! There's a <code>pop</code> command to remove the most recently added section if something goes wrong, a <code>verify</code> command to re-run the document and check nothing has changed (I'm not entirely convinced by the design of that one) and a <code>extract</code> command that reverse-engineers the CLI commands that were used to create the document.</p>\n<p>It's pretty simple - just 172 lines of Go.</p>\n<p>I packaged it up with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">go-to-wheel</a> tool which means you can run it without even installing it first like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx showboat --help</pre></div>\n<p>That <code>--help</code> command is really important: it's designed to provide a coding agent with <em>everything it needs to know</em> in order to use the tool. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/main/help.txt\">that help text in full</a>.</p>\n<p>This means you can pop open Claude Code and tell it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run \"uvx showboat --help\" and then use showboat to create a demo.md document describing the feature you just built</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's it! The <code>--help</code> text acts <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/\">a bit like a Skill</a>. Your agent can read the help text and use every feature of Showboat to create a document that demonstrates whatever it is you need demonstrated.</p>\n<p>Here's a fun trick: if you set Claude off to build a Showboat document you can pop that open in VS Code and watch the preview pane update in real time as the agent runs through the demo. It's a bit like having your coworker talk you through their latest work in a screensharing session.</p>\n<p>And finally, some examples. Here are documents I had Claude create using Showboat to help demonstrate features I was working on in other projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/shot-scraper/README.md\">shot-scraper: A Comprehensive Demo</a> runs through the full suite of features of my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper</a> browser automation tool, mainly to exercise the <code>showboat image</code> command.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/cli.md\">sqlite-history-json CLI demo</a> demonstrates the CLI feature I added to my new <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json\">sqlite-history-json</a> Python library.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/row-state-sql.md\">row-state-sql CLI Demo</a> shows a new <code>row-state-sql</code> command I added to that same project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-history-json/blob/main/demos/change-grouping.md\">Change grouping with Notes</a> demonstrates another feature where groups of changes within the same transaction can have a note attached to them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/libkrun-go-cli-tool/demo.md\">krunsh: Pipe Shell Commands to an Ephemeral libkrun MicroVM</a> is a particularly convoluted example where I managed to get Claude Code for web to run a libkrun microVM inside a QEMU emulated Linux environment inside the Claude gVisor sandbox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've now used Showboat often enough that I've convinced myself of its utility.</p>\n<p>(I've also seen agents cheat! Since the demo file is Markdown the agent will sometimes edit that file directly rather than using Showboat, which could result in command outputs that don't reflect what actually happened. Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/issues/12\">an issue about that</a>.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"rodney-cli-browser-automation-designed-to-work-with-showboat\">Rodney: CLI browser automation designed to work with Showboat</h4>\n<p>Many of the projects I work on involve web interfaces. Agents often build entirely new pages for these, and I want to see those represented in the demos.</p>\n<p>Showboat's image feature was designed to allow agents to capture screenshots as part of their demos, originally using my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper tool</a> or <a href=\"https://www.playwright.dev\">Playwright</a>.</p>\n<p>The Showboat format benefits from CLI utilities. I went looking for good options for managing a multi-turn browser session from a CLI and came up short, so I decided to try building something new.</p>\n<p>Claude Opus 4.6 pointed me to the <a href=\"https://github.com/go-rod/rod\">Rod</a> Go library for interacting with the Chrome DevTools protocol. It's fantastic - it provides a comprehensive wrapper across basically everything you can do with automated Chrome, all in a self-contained library that compiles to a few MBs.</p>\n<p>All Rod was missing was a CLI.</p>\n<p>I built the first version <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/go-rod-cli/README.md\">as an asynchronous report prototype</a>, which convinced me it was worth spinning out into its own project.</p>\n<p>I called it Rodney as a nod to the Rod library it builds on and a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses\">Only Fools and Horses</a> - and because the package name was available on PyPI.</p>\n<p>You can run Rodney using <code>uvx rodney</code> or install it like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uv tool install rodney</pre></div>\n<p>(Or grab a Go binary <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/releases/\">from the releases page</a>.)</p>\n<p>Here's a simple example session:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>rodney start <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> starts Chrome in the background</span>\nrodney open https://datasette.io/\nrodney js <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney click <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>a[href=\"/for\"]<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\nrodney js location.href\nrodney js document.title\nrodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\nrodney stop</pre></div>\n<p>Here's what that looks like in the terminal:</p>\n<p><img alt=\";~ % rodney start\nChrome started (PID 91462)\nDebug URL: ws://127.0.0.1:64623/devtools/browser/cac6988e-8153-483b-80b9-1b75c611868d\n~ % rodney open https://datasette.io/\nDatasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data\n~ % rodney js 'Array.from(document.links).map(el =&gt; el.href).slice(0, 5)'\n[\n&quot;https://datasette.io/for&quot;,\n&quot;https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/tutorials&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/examples&quot;,\n&quot;https://datasette.io/plugins&quot;\n]\n~ % rodney click 'a[href=&quot;/for&quot;]'\nClicked\n~ % rodney js location.href\nhttps://datasette.io/for\n~ % rodney js document.title\nUse cases for Datasette\n~ % rodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\ndatasette-for-page.png\n~ % rodney stop\nChrome stopped\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/rodney-demo.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" /></p>\n<p>As with Showboat, this tool is not designed to be used by humans! The goal is for coding agents to be able to run <code>rodney --help</code> and see everything they need to know to start using the tool. You can see <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/help.txt\">that help output</a> in the GitHub repo.</p>\n<p>Here are three demonstrations of Rodney that I created using Showboat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/rodney/README.md\">Rodney's original feature set</a>, including screenshots of pages and executing JavaScript.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/notes/accessibility-features/README.md\">Rodney's new accessibility testing features</a>, built during development of those features to show what they could do.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/datasette-database-page-accessibility-audit/README.md\">Using those features to run a basic accessibility audit of a page</a>. I was impressed at how well Claude Opus 4.6 responded to the prompt \"Use showboat and rodney to perform an accessibility audit of <a href=\"https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures\">https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures</a>\" - <a href=\"https://gisthost.github.io/?dce6b2680db4b05c04469ed8f251eb34/index.html\">transcript here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"test-driven-development-helps-but-we-still-need-manual-testing\">Test-driven development helps, but we still need manual testing</h4>\n<p>After being a career-long skeptic of the test-first, maximum test coverage school of software development (I like <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/#tests\">tests included</a> development instead) I've recently come around to test-first processes as a way to force agents to write only the code that's necessary to solve the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>Many of my Python coding agent sessions start the same way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Run the existing tests with \"uv run pytest\". Build using red/green TDD.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Telling the agents how to run the tests doubles as an indicator that tests on this project exist and matter. Agents will read existing tests before writing their own so having a clean test suite with good patterns makes it more likely they'll write good tests of their own.</p>\n<p>The frontier models all understand that \"red/green TDD\" means they should write the test first, run it and watch it fail and then write the code to make it pass - it's a convenient shortcut.</p>\n<p>I find this greatly increases the quality of the code and the likelihood that the agent will produce the right thing with the smallest amount of prompts to guide it.</p>\n<p>But anyone who's worked with tests will know that just because the automated tests pass doesn't mean the software actually works! That’s the motivation behind Showboat and Rodney - I never trust any feature until I’ve seen it running with my own eye.</p>\n<p>Before building Showboat I'd often add a “manual” testing step to my agent sessions, something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Once the tests pass, start a development server and exercise the new feature using curl</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"i-built-both-of-these-tools-on-my-phone\">I built both of these tools on my phone</h4>\n<p>Both Showboat and Rodney started life as Claude Code for web projects created via the Claude iPhone app. Most of the ongoing feature work for them happened in the same way.</p>\n<p>I'm still a little startled at how much of my coding work I get done on my phone now, but I'd estimate that the majority of code I ship to GitHub these days was written for me by coding agents driven via that iPhone app.</p>\n<p>I initially designed these two tools for use in asynchronous coding agent environments like Claude Code for the web. So far that's working out really well.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/go\">go</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/testing\">testing</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/markdown\">markdown</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/async-coding-agents\">async-coding-agents</a></p>\n    \n\n",

    "title": "On screwing up",
    "link": "https://seangoedecke.com/screwing-up/",
    "content": "<p>The most shameful thing I did in the workplace was lie to a colleague. It was about ten years ago, I was a fresh-faced intern, and in the rush to deliver something I’d skipped the step of testing my work in staging<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. It did not work. When deployed to production, it didn’t work there either. No big deal, in general terms: the page we were working on wasn’t yet customer-facing. But my colleague asked me over his desk whether this worked when I’d tested it, and I said something like “it sure did, no idea what happened”.</p>\n<p>I bet he forgot about it immediately. I could have just messed up the testing (for instance, by accidentally running some different code than the code I pushed), or he knew I’d probably lied, and didn’t really care. I haven’t forgotten about it. Even a decade later, I’m still ashamed to write it down.</p>\n<p>Of course I’m not ashamed about the <em>mistake</em>. I was sloppy to not test my work, but I’ve cut corners since then when I felt it was necessary, and I stand by that decision. I’m ashamed about how I handled it. But even that I understand. I was a kid, trying to learn quickly and prove I belonged in tech. The last thing I wanted to do was to dwell on the way I screwed up. If I were in my colleague’s shoes now, I’d have brushed it off too<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>. How do I try to handle mistakes now?</p>\n<h3>Handling the emotional reaction</h3>\n<p>The most important thing is to <strong>control your emotions</strong>. If you’re anything like me, your strongest emotional reactions at work will be reserved for the times you’ve screwed up. There are usually two countervailing emotions at play here: the desire to defend yourself, find excuses, and minimize the consequences; and the desire to confess your guilt, abase yourself, and beg for forgiveness. Both of these are traps. </p>\n<p>Obviously making excuses for yourself (or flat-out denying the mistake, like I did) is bad. But going in the other direction and publicly beating yourself up about it is <em>just as bad</em>. It’s bad for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>First, you’re effectively asking the people around you to take the time and effort to reassure you, when they should be focused on the problem. Second, you’re taking yourself out of the group of people who are focused on the problem, when often you’re the best situated to figure out what to do: since it’s your mistake, you have the most context. Third, it’s just not professional. </p>\n<p>So what should you do? <strong>For the first little while, <em>do nothing</em>.</strong> Emotional reactions fade over time. Try and just ride out the initial jolt of realizing you screwed up, and the impulse to leap into action to fix it. Most of the worst reactions to screwing up happen in the immediate aftermath, so if you can simply do nothing during that period you’re already off to a good start. For me, this takes about thirty seconds. How much time you’ll need depends on you, but hopefully it’s under ten minutes. More than that and you might need to grit your teeth and work through it.</p>\n<h3>Communicate</h3>\n<p>Once you’re confident you’re under control, the next step is to <strong>tell people what happened</strong>. Typically you want to tell your manager, but depending on the problem it could also be a colleague or someone else. It’s really important here to be matter-of-fact about it, or you risk falling into the “I’m so terrible, please reassure me” trap I discussed above. You often don’t even need to explicitly say “I made a mistake”, if it’s obvious from context. Just say “I deployed a change and it’s broken X feature” (or whatever the problem is).</p>\n<p>You should do this <em>before</em> you’ve come up with a solution. It’s tempting to try to conceal your mistake and just quietly solve it. But for user-facing mistakes, concealment is impossible - somebody will raise a ticket eventually - and if you don’t communicate the issue, you risk someone else discovering it and independently raising it.</p>\n<p>In the worst case, while you’re quietly working on a fix, you’ll discover that somebody else has declared an incident. Of course, you understand the problem perfectly (since you caused it), and you know that it was caused by a bad deploy and is easily fixable. But the other people on the incident call don’t know all that. They’re thinking about the worst-case scenarios, wondering if it’s database or network-related, paging in all kinds of teams, causing all kinds of hassle. All of that could have been avoided if you had reported the issue immediately.</p>\n<p>In my experience, tech company managers will forgive mistakes<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>, but <strong>they won’t forgive being made to look like a fool</strong>. In particular, they won’t forgive being deprived of critical information. If they’re asked to explain the incident by their boss, and they have to flounder around because they lack the context <em>that you had all along</em>, that may harm your relationship with them for good. On the other hand, if you give them a clear summary of the problem right away, and they’re able to seem like they’re on top of things to their manager, you <em>might</em> even earn credit for the situation (despite having caused it with your initial mistake).</p>\n<h3>Accept that it’s going to hurt</h3>\n<p>However, you probably won’t earn credit. This is where I diverge from the popular software engineering wisdom that incidents are always the fault of systems, never of individuals. Of course incidents are caused by the interactions of complex systems. Everything in the universe is caused by the interactions of complex systems! But one cause in that chain is often <em>somebody screwing up</em><sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>If you’re a manager of an engineering organization, and you want a project to succeed, you probably have a mental shortlist of the engineers in your org who can reliably lead projects<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>. If an engineer screws up repeatedly, they’re likely to drop off that list (or at least get an asterisk next to their name).</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter if you had a good technical reason to make the mistake, or if it’s excusable. Managers don’t care about that stuff, because they simply don’t have the technical context to know if it’s true or if you’re just trying to talk your way out of it. What managers do have the context to evaluate is <em>results</em>, so that’s what they judge you on. That means some failures are acceptable, so long as you’ve got enough successes to balance them out.</p>\n<p>Being a strong engineer is about finding a balance between <a href=\"/being-right-a-lot\">always being right</a> and <a href=\"/taking-a-position\">taking risks</a>. If you prioritize always being right, you can probably avoid making mistakes, but you won’t be able to lead projects (since that always requires taking risks). Therefore, <strong>the optimal amount of mistakes at work is not zero.</strong> Unless you’re working in a few select industries<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup>, you should <em>expect</em> to make mistakes now and then, otherwise you’re likely working far too slow. </p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>From memory, I think I <em>had</em> tested an earlier version of the code, but then I made some tweaks and skipped the step where I tested that it worked even with those tweaks.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Though I would have made a mental note (and if someone more senior had done this, I would have been a bit less forgiving).</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>Though they may not forget them.

This is a wryly funny and cosily charming book about council funerals.</p>\n\n<p>Evie King conducts Section 46 funerals under the Public Health Act. If you die and there's no one else around who is able to arrange your funeral, the local council steps in. This could be a coldly bureaucratic process with no wiggle room for anything other than perfunctory sympathy. But humans are going to human. Why <em>wouldn't</em> you put some effort in to making people feel cherished in death?</p>\n\n<p>In many ways, this is what Cameron's \"Big Society\" should have been about. Giving empathetic and passionate people a chance to serve their community and enrich all our lives. And, I guess, deaths. But austerity makes it hard to stay motivated when you're doing multiple people's jobs for a fraction of the pay.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't to say King is a whinger - quite the opposite - but she is clearly frustrated that she cannot do more. People who interact with the state are rarely in a good emotional or financial place. Those interacting with Section 46 deserve more support than is available to them. What King does is marvellous - but necessarily limited. In effect, it is a series of short stories each taking a look at a different death and how she tried as hard as possible to make the funeral process as painless and uplifting as it can be.</p>\n\n<p>The book is, naturally, a little upsetting in places. It isn't so much that people die; it is how society reacts which causes such emotional turmoil. Why are people sometimes abandoned? Why do reconciliations never happen until it is too late? How do we deal with trauma?</p>\n\n<p>It is an excellent book but it is rather annoying that the publisher, <a href=\"https://www.mirrorbooks.co.uk/\">Mirror Books</a> only makes the eBook available via Amazon. There's no other way to read it - not even via a library! I resorted to borrowing the audiobook. This was the first audiobook I've ever listened to - and it was a rather curious experience. The author's voice was slightly hesitant at first, but gradually became more passionate and evocative. It was wonderful to hear her tell her story directly.</p>\n",

They were woven into the core of Blade Runner's society with a temporal Sword of Damocles hung over their head: four years of life, not a day more. This made replicants desperate to cling to life; they'd kill for the chance of an hour more. This is why the job of the Blade Runner was so deadly.</p>\n        <p>Metanarratively, the replicants weren't the problem. The problem was the people that made them. The people that gave them the ability to think. The ability to feel. The ability to understand and emphathize. The problem was the people that gave them the ability to enjoy life and then hit them with a temporal Sword of Damocles overhead because those replicants were fundamentally disposable.</p>\n        <p>In Blade Runner, the true horror was not the technology. The technology worked fine. The horror was the deployment and the societal implications around making people disposable.

Enjoy being cursed for life!</p></div></div></div>\n        <p>I keep thinking about those scenes when I watch people interact with AI agents. With these new flows, the cost to integrate any two systems is approaching zero; the most expensive thing is time. People don't read documentation anymore, that's a job for their AI agents. Mental labour is shifting from flesh and blood to HBM and coil whine. The thing doing the &quot;actual work&quot; is its own kind of replicant and as long as the results &quot;work&quot;, many humans don't even review the output before shipping it.</p>\n        <p>Looking at this, I think I see where a future could end up. Along this line, I've started to think about how programming is going to change and what humanity's &quot;last programming language&quot; could look like. I don't think we'll stop making new ones (nerds are compulsive language designers), but I think that in the fallout of AI tools being so widespread the <em>shape</em> of what &quot;a program&quot; is might be changing drastically out from under us while we argue about tabs, spaces, and database frameworks.</p>\n        <p>Let's consider a future where markdown files are the new executables. For the sake of argument, let's call this result Markdownlang.</p>\n        <h2>Markdownlang</h2>\n        <p>Markdownlang is an AI-native programming environment built with structured outputs and Markdown. Every markdownlang program is an AI agent with its own agentic loop generating output or calling tools to end up with structured output following a per-program schema.</p>\n        <p>Instead of using a parser, lexer, or traditional programming runtime, markdownlang programs are executed by large language models running an agentic inference loop with structured JSON and a templated prompt as an input and then emitting structured JSON as a response.</p>\n        <p>Markdownlang programs can import other markdownlang programs as dependencies. In that case they will just show up as other tools like any other. If you need to interact with existing systems or programs, you are expected to expose those tools via <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro\">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> servers. MCP tools get added to the runtime the same way any other tools would. Those MCP tools are how you do web searches, make GitHub issues, or update tickets in Linear.</p>\n        <h3>Why?</h3>\n        <p>Before you ask why, lemme cover the state of the art with the AI ecosystem for discrete workflows like the kind markdownlang enables: it's a complete fucking nightmare. Every week we get new agent frameworks, DSLs, paridigms, or CLI tools that only work with one provider for no reason. In a desperate attempt to appear relevant, everything has massive complexity creep requiring you(r AI agent) to write miles of YAML, struggle through brittle orchestration, and makes debugging a nightmare.</p>\n        <p>The hype says that this mess will replace programmers, but speaking as someone who uses these tools professionally in an effort to figure out if there really is something there to them, I'm not really sure it will. Even accounting for multiple generational improvements.</p>\n        <h3>The core of markdownlang</h3>\n        <p>With this in mind, let's take a look at what markdownlang brings to the table.</p>\n        <p>The most important concept with markdownlang is that your documentation and your code are the same thing. One of the biggest standing problems with documentation is that the best way to make any bit of it out of date is to write it down in any capacity. Testing documentation becomes onerous because over time humans gain enough finesse to not require it anymore. One of the biggest advantages of AI models for this usecase is that they legitimately cannot remember things between tasks, so your documentation being bad means the program won't execute consistently.</p>\n        <p>Other than that, everything is just a composable agent. Agents become tools that can be used by other agents, and strictly typed schemata holds the entire façade together. No magic required.</p>\n        <p>Oh, also the markdownlang runtime has an embedded python interpreter using WebAssembly and WASI. The runtime does not have access to any local filesystem folders. It is purely there because language models have been trained to shell out to Python to do calculations (I'm assuming someone was inspired by <a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/strawberry\">my satirical post where I fixed the &quot;strawberry&quot; problem with AI models</a>).</p>\n        <h2>Fizzbuzz</h2>\n        <p>Here's what Fizzbuzz looks like in markdownlang:</p>\n        <pre

abstraction</h2>\n        <p>Yeah, I realize that a lot of this is high-brow shitposting, but really the best way to think about something like markdownlang is that it's a new layer of abstraction. In something like markdownlang the real abstraction you deal with is the specifications that you throw around in Jira/Linear instead of dealing with the low level machine pedantry that is endemic to programming in today's Internet.</p>\n        <p>Imagine how much more you could get done if you could just ask the computer to do it. This is the end of syntax issues, of semicolon fights, of memorizing APIs, of compiler errors because some joker used sed to replace semicolons with greek question marks. Everything becomes strictly typed data that acts as the guardrails between snippets of truly high level language.</p>\n        <p>Like, looking at the entire langle mangle programming space from that angle, the user experience at play here is that kind of science fiction magic you see in Star Trek. You just ask the computer to adjust the Norokov phase variance of the phasers to a triaxilating frequency and it figures out what you mean and does it. This is the kind of magic that Apple said they'd do with AI in their big keynote <a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/squandered-holy-grail/\">right before they squandered that holy grail</a>.</p>\n        <p>Even then, this is still just programming. Schemata are your new types, imports are your new dependencies, composition is your new architecture, debugging is still debugging, and the massive MCP ecosystem becomes an integration boon instead of a burden.</p>\n        <p>Markdownlang is just a tool. Large language models can (and let's face it: will) make mistakes. Schemata can't express absolutely everything. Someone needs to write these agents and even if something like this becomes so widespread, I'm pretty sure that programmers are still safe in terms of their jobs.</p>\n        <p>If only because in order for us to truly be replaced, the people that hire us have to know what they want at a high enough level of detail in order to specify it such that markdownlang can make it possible. I'd be willing to argue that when we get hired as programmers, we get hired to have that level of deep clear thinking to be able to come up with the kinds of requirements to get to the core business goal regardless of the tools we use to get it done.</p>\n        <p>It's not <em>that</em> deep.</p>\n        <h2>Future ideas</h2>\n        <p>From here something like this has many obvious and immediate usecases. It's quite literally a universal lingua franca for integrating any square peg into any other round hole. The big directions I could go from here include:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Some kind of web platform for authoring and deploying markdownlang programs (likely with some level of MCP exposure so that you can tell your Claude Code to make an agent do something every hour or so and have it just Do The Right Thing™️ spawning something in the background).</li>\n        <li>It would be really funny to make a <code>markdownlang compile</code> command that just translates the markdownlang program to Go, Python, or JavaScript; complete with the MCP imports as direct function calls.</li>\n        <li>I'd love to make some kind of visual flow editor in that web platform, maybe there's some kind of product potential here. It would be really funny to attribute markdownlang to Techaro's AGI lab (Lygma).</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>But really, I think working on markdownlang (I do have a fully working version of it, I'm not releasing it yet) has made me understand a lot more of the nuance that I feel with AI tools. That melodrama of Blade Runner has been giving me pause when I look at what I have just created and making me understand the true horror of why I find AI tooling so cool and disturbing at the same time.</p>\n        <p>The problem is not the technology. The real horror reveals itself when you consider how technology is deployed and the societal implications around what could happen when a tool like markdownlang makes programmers like me societally disposable. When &quot;good enough&quot; becomes the ceiling instead of the floor, we're going to lose something we can't easily get back.</p>\n        <p>The real horror for me is knowing that this kind of tool is not only possible to build with things off the shelf, but knowing that I did build it by having a small swarm of Claudes Code go off and build it while I did raiding in Final Fantasy 14. I haven't looked at basically any of the code (intentionally, it's part of The Bit™️), and it just works well enough that I didn't feel the need to dig into it in much detail. It's as if programmers now have our own Sword of Damocles over our heads because management can point at the tool and say &quot;behave more like this or we'll replace you&quot;.</p>\n        <p>This is the level of nuance I feel about this technology that can't fit into a single tweet. I love this idea of programming as description, but I hate how something like this will be treated by the market should it be widely released.</p>\n        <div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" alt=\"Cadey is coffee\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee\"/></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey\">Cadey</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>For those of you entrenched in The Deep Lore™️, this post was authored in the\n        voice of <a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters/#numa\">Numa</a>.</p></div></div></div>\n      ",

    "content": "<p>Some time ago, I noted that <a title=\"Why did the Windows 95 CD have extra fun stuff?\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060103-52/?p=32853\"> the Windows 95 CD contained a variety of multimedia extras</a>, partly because they were fun, and partly to show off Windows 95&#8217;s multimedia capabilities.</p>\n<p>One of those multimedia extras was the music video for the song <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly_(song)\">Buddy Holly</a></i> by the band <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer\">Weezer</a>. Acquiring permission to redistribute the video took multiple steps.</p>\n<p>First, Microsoft had to secure the rights to the song itself, which was negotiated directly with Weezer&#8217;s publisher Geffen Records, and apparently <a title=\"Knowledge Drop: Weezer Had No Idea The Music Video For \" href=\"https://genius.com/a/weezer-had-no-idea-the-music-video-for-buddy-holly-would-be-included-with-windows-95\"> without the knowledge of the band members themselves</a>. They were reportedly upset that they weren&#8217;t consulted but later realized that it was &#8220;one of the greatest things that could have happened to us. Can you imagine that happening today? It&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s one video on YouTube, and it&#8217;s your video.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But that only secured the rights to the music. What about the video?</p>\n<p>The video takes place in a reconstruction of a location from the <i>Happy Days</i> television program, and clips from that show were spliced into the music video to create the illusion that many of the characters from the show were part of the video. The lawyer responsible for securing the rights to the video had to contact all of the actors from <i>Happy Days</i> to get their permission. That lawyer thoroughly enjoyed the assignment. I don&#8217;t know whether he got to talk to the actors directly, or only to their agents, but I can imagine it being an interesting experience trying to find Henry Winkler&#8217;s telephone number (or his agent&#8217;s telephone number) with a chance of talking to The Fonz himself.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260210-00/?p=112052\">How did Windows 95 get permission to put the Weezer video &lt;I&gt;Buddy Holly&lt;/I&gt; on the CD?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing\">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>\n",

A fellow commissioner and I decided to take a long lunchtime walk along the coast. As we chatted, we realized we had both worked on several of the same very classified programs. His involvement was in acquisition and finance, while mine was more deeply connected to the engineering development of the project and hands-on with the operators on site.</span></p>\n<p><b>We Got Our Advanced Technology From Aliens<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we both were discreet about not talking about specifics, we recognized the projects we had worked on. So you can imagine my surprise when he turned to me and casually said, &#8220;You know this technology came from aliens.&#8221; I laughed, thinking that obviously he must be joking. But as we continued walking he continued on, claiming, “You know the equipment you worked on and stuff that followed came from our secret alien investigation site at <a href=\"https://www.military.com/off-duty/2020/12/18/6-urban-legends-about-wright-patterson-air-force-base.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wright Patterson Air Force Base</a>. All we did was reverse engineer Alien technology.” This time I stopped in my tracks and looked at him to see if he was smiling. I was puzzled as he looked dead serious. He explained that there was no possible way we could be doing what we were doing using existing technology. Before I changed the subject I asked him how he knew this, he replied with absolute sincerity, “I was head of acquisition on the program. I was briefed on the project. That&#8217;s what they told us and they swore us to secrecy.“<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"33503\" data-permalink=\"https://steveblank.com/2026/02/10/revisionist-history-aliens-secrets-and-conspiracies/ai-creation-of-adam/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?fit=2122%2C1014&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2122,1014\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"AI Creation of Adam\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?fit=300%2C143&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?fit=468%2C223&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-33503\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=300%2C143&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=300%2C143&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=1024%2C489&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=150%2C72&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=768%2C367&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=1536%2C734&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?resize=2048%2C979&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AI-Creation-of-Adam.jpg?w=1404&amp;ssl=1 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I really didn&#8217;t know how to process this. He was really a smart and level-headed guy. In fact he was the mayor at the time of Rancho Palos Verde. It took me a mile or two into our walk to rethink everything I knew about the project (even then it had been in decades past), including having sat with a few of the engineers (some strange, but not aliens) as they were designing the system (with me trying to keep up with the revised blueprints in document control), and then watching the system being built and assembled. While it had required incredibly creative engineering, and applying technology on a scale so massive no commercial company could afford it, this system was built by smart people with no aliens involved. But he was equally convinced they were. Over our time together on the commission we took more walks, had lots more to talk about, but we never broached the subject again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every once in a while, for the next few years, I puzzled on how he could have been so sure of something that I was sure was completely wrong.</span></p>\n<p><b>We Did Tell Them It Was Aliens<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward 15 years, and my world view of that conversation was upended when I read in the </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the Department of Defense had been running a disinformation campaign, briefing finance and acquisition people that the technology for these classified programs </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> coming from aliens. (Take a minute and </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">read the article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of a sudden our coast-side conversation from a decade and a half ago made sense to me. Most of our most compartmentalized programs have different levels of what was called &#8220;</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need to know</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&#8221; I never paid much attention as I was </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">read all the way into</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the technical and operational details of these programs. I vaguely knew that others got fewer details, but as I was just discovering, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">others had received active disinformation</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In a few cases, security officers were even using fake photos and documents to create the Alien cover-story for secret-weapons programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turns out my fellow commissioner had been briefed by the U.S. government that it was Aliens, and he went to his grave believing it so. </span></p>\n<p><b>Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s interesting is what happened after the news came out that the Alien story was government disinformation. A large percentage of people who were briefed, now &#8220;doubled down&#8221; and believed “we got the technology from Aliens” even more strongly &#8211; believing the new information itself was a coverup. Many dismissed the facts by prioritizing how they felt over reality, something we often see in political or religious contexts. (“Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?”)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wondered how my friend would have reacted.</span></p>\n<p><b>Secrecy, Disinformation, and a Higher Power<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While on its face this is an amusing story about secrecy, it’s really about the intersection of the secrecy&#8217;s impact on society and its role in misinformation, manipulation, the creation of cynicism and mistrust, and our need to believe in a higher power.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"33555\" data-permalink=\"https://steveblank.com/2026/02/10/revisionist-history-aliens-secrets-and-conspiracies/the-impact-of-government-secrecy/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?fit=881%2C877&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"881,877\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"The Impact of Government Secrecy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?fit=468%2C466&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-33555 alignright\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?resize=768%2C765&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-Impact-of-Government-Secrecy.jpg?w=881&amp;ssl=1 881w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p><b><i>Manipulation<br />\n</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of secrecy used for manipulation in the 20th century was when the </span><a href=\"https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/article/opening-the-venona-files/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Security Agency Venona </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unmasked Soviet spies</a> in the U.S. Even though this was one of the nation&#8217;s most secret programs, the FBI leaked its findings to Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon. They used this classified knowledge to manipulate the American public, fueling McCarthyism and Richard Nixon’s career. 50 years later, when </span><a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/Helpful-Links/NSA-FOIA/Declassification-Transparency-Initiatives/Historical-Releases/Venona/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venona</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was made public historians substantively revised the history of U.S. Cold War politics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 21st century Social Media misinformation (e.g. Chinese and Russian influence campaigns, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qanon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> conspiracies) will look like toys next to the AI-driven manipulation that’s about to come.</span></p>\n<p><em><b>Cynicism and mistrust<br />\n</b></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secrecy created 75 years of cynicism and mistrust, when the U.S. began launching highly classified reconnaissance balloons (story </span><a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2010/01/28/balloon-wars/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), and later the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes. These top secret projects gave rise to decades of UFO sightings. Instead of acknowledging these sightings were from classified military projects the Department of Defense issued cover stories (&#8220;you saw weather balloons&#8221;) that weren&#8217;t believable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Governments and companies have always kept secrets and used misinformation and manipulation. However, things stay secret way too long &#8211; for many reasons &#8211; some reasonable (we’re still using the same methods &#8211; reconnaissance technology, tradecraft, or, it would harm people still alive &#8211; retired spies, etc) or not so reasonable (we broke U.S. or international laws &#8211; </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COINTELPRO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or it would embarrass us or our allies &#8211; Kennedy assassination, or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Epstein files</a>).  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secrecy increases the odds of conspiracy beliefs. Because evidence can’t be checked, contradictions can’t be audited, a government “cover-up” becomes a plausible explanation. People don’t tolerate “I don’t know” for long when stakes are high (stolen elections, identity, national crises, the meaning of life, or what happens when we die). That vacuum gets filled by the most emotionally satisfying model: a hidden “higher power” concealing information and controlling events.</span></p>\n<p><b>Summary<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as social media replaced traditional news sources, AI-driven summaries of current events are likely to replace our understanding of the world around us. What happens to trust when AI manipulates human&#8217;s tendency to embrace conspiracy theories? Who will define the truth in the brave new world?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And by the way, I’m still pretty sure we didn&#8217;t get it from Aliens.</span></p>\n",
