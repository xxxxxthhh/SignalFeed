That actually exists! It's called Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the \"anticircumvention\" clause, which establishes five-year sentences and $500k fines for anyone who bypasses an \"effective access control\" for a copyrighted work.</p>\n<p>Let's unpack that: every digital product has a \"copyrighted work\" at its core, because software is copyrighted. Digital systems are intrinsically very flexible: just overwrite, augment, or delete part of the software that powers the device or product, and you change how the product works. You can alter your browser to block ads; or alter your Android phone to run a privacy-respecting OS like Graphene; or alter your printer to accept generic ink, rather than checking each cartridge to confirm that it's the original manufacturer's product.</p>\n<p>However, if the device is designed to prevent this &#8211; if it has an \"access control\" that restricts your ability to change the software &#8211; then DMCA 1201 makes those modifications into crimes. The act of providing someone with a tool to change how their own property works (\"trafficking in circumvention devices\") is a felony.</p>\n<p>But there's a tiny saving grace here: for DMCA 1201 to kick in, the \"access control\" must be \"effective.\" What's \"effective?\" There's the rub: no one knows.</p>\n<p>The penalties for getting crosswise with DMCA 1201 are so grotendous that very few people have tried to litigate any of its contours. Whenever the issue comes up, defendants settle, or fold, or disappear. Despite the fact that DMCA 1201 has been with us for more than a quarter of a century, and despite the fact that the activities it restricts are <em>so</em> far-reaching, there's precious little case law clarifying Congress's vague statutory language.</p>\n<p>When it comes to \"effectiveness\" in access controls, the jurisprudence is especially thin. As far as I know, there's just one case that addressed the issue, and boy was it a weird one. Back in 2000, a \"colorful\" guy named Johnny Deep founded a Napster-alike service that piggybacked on the AOL Instant Messenger network. He called his service \"Aimster.\" When AOL threatened him with a trademark suit, he claimed that Aimster was his daughter Amiee's AOL handle, and that the service was named for her. Then he changed the service's name to Madster, claiming that it was <em>also</em> named after his daughter. At the time, a lot of people assumed he was BSing, but I just found his obituary and it turns out his daughter's name was, indeed, \"Amiee (Madeline) Deep\":</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Madster-creator-Cohoes-native-who-fought-record-11033636.php\">https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Madster-creator-Cohoes-native-who-fought-record-11033636.php</a></p>\n<p>Aimster was one of the many services that the record industry tried to shut down, both by filing suit against the company and by flooding it with takedown notices demanding that individual tracks be removed. Deep responded by \"encoding\" all of the track names on his network in pig-Latin. Then he claimed that by \"decoding\" the files (by moving the last letter of the track name to the first position), the record industry was \"bypassing an effective access control for a copyrighted work\" and thus violating DMCA 1201:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=108454&amp;amp;page=1\">https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=108454&amp;amp;page=1</a></p>\n<p>The court didn't buy this. The judge ruled that pig Latin isn't an \"effective access control.\" Since then, we've known that at least <em>some</em> access controls aren't \"effective\" but we haven't had any clarity on where \"effectiveness\" starts. After all, there's a certain circularity to the whole idea of \"effective\" access controls: if a rival engineer can figure out how to get around an access control, can we really call it \"effective?\" Surely, the fact that someone figured out how to circumvent your access control is proof that it's <em>not</em> effective (at least when it comes to that person).</p>\n<p>All this may strike you as weird inside baseball, and that's not entirely wrong, but there's one unresolved \"effectiveness\" question that has some very high stakes indeed: is Youtube's javascript-based obfuscation an \"effective access control?\"</p>\n<p>Youtube, of course, is the internet's monopoly video platform, with a commanding majority of video streams. It was acquired by Google in 2006 for $1.65b. At the time, the service was hemorrhaging money and mired in brutal litigation, but it had one virtue that made it worth nine figures: people liked it. Specifically, people liked it in a way they didn't like Google Video, which was one of the many, many, many failed internally developed Google products that tanked, and was replaced by a product developed by a company that Google bought, because Google sucks at developing products. They're not Willy Wonka's idea factory &#8211; they're Rich Uncle Pennybags, buying up other kids' toys:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/google-ai-chatbots-microsoft-bing-chatgpt/673052/\">https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/google-ai-chatbots-microsoft-bing-chatgpt/673052/</a></p>\n<p>Google operationalized Youtube and built it up to the world's most structurally important video platform. Along the way, Google added some javascript that was intended to block people from \"downloading\" its videos. I put \"downloading\" in scare-quotes because \"streaming\" is a consensus hallucination: there is no way for your computer to display a video that resides on a distant server without downloading it &#8211; the internet is not made up of a cunning series of paper-towel rolls and mirrors that convey photons to your screen without sending you the bits that make up the file. \"Streaming\" is just \"downloading\" with the \"save file\" button removed.</p>\n<p>In this case, the \"save file\" button is removed by some javascript on every Youtube page. This isn't hard to bypass: there are dozens of \"stream-ripping\" sites that let you save any video that's accessible on Youtube. I use these all the time &#8211; indeed, I used one last week to gank the video of my speech in Ottawa so I could upload it to my own Youtube channel:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxbaCNIwg8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZxbaCNIwg8</a></p>\n<p>(As well as the Internet Archive, natch):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation\">https://archive.org/details/disenshittification-nation</a></p>\n<p>Now, all of this violates Youtube's terms of service, which means that someone who downloads a stream for an otherwise lawful purpose (like I did) is still hypothetically at risk of being punished by Google. We're relying on Google to be reasonable about all this, which, admittedly, isn't the best bet, historically. But at least the field of people who can attack us is limited to this one company.</p>\n<p>That's good, because there's <em>zillions</em> of people who rely on stream-rippers, and many of them are Youtube's most popular creators. Youtube singlehandedly revived the form of the \"video essay,\" popularizing it in many guises, from \"reaction videos\" to full-fledged, in-depth documentaries that make extensive use of clips to illuminate, dispute, and expand on the messages of other Youtube videos.</p>\n<p>These kinds of videos are allowed under US copyright law. American copyright law has a broad set of limitation and exceptions, which include \"fair use,\" an expansive set of affirmative rights to access and use copyrighted works, <em>even against the wishes of the copyright's proprietor</em>. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Eldred</em>, the only way copyright (a government-backed restriction on who can say certain words) can be reconciled with the First Amendment (a ban on government restrictions on speech) is through fair use, the \"escape valve\" for free expression embedded in copyright:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft</a></p>\n<p>Which is to say that including clips from a video you're criticizing in your own video is canonical fair use. What else is fair use? Well, it's \"fact intensive,\" which is a lawyer's way of saying, \"it depends.\" One thing that is 100% true, though, is that fair use is <em>not</em> limited to the \"four factors\" enumerated in the statute and anyone who claims otherwise has no idea what they're talking about and can be safely ignored:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/27/nuke-first/#ask-questions-never\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/27/nuke-first/#ask-questions-never</a></p>\n<p>Now, fair use or not, there are plenty of people who get angry about their videos being clipped for critical treatment in other videos, because lots of people hate being criticized. This is precisely why fair use exists: if you had to secure someone's permission before you were allowed to criticize them, critical speech would be limited to takedowns of stoics and masochists.</p>\n<p>This means that the subjects of video essays can't rely on copyright to silence their critics. They also can't use the fact that those critics violated Youtube's terms of service by clipping their videos, because only Youtube has standing to ask a court to uphold its terms of service, and Youtube has (wisely) steered clear of embroiling itself in fights between critics and the people they criticize.</p>\n<p>But that hasn't stopped the subjects of criticism from seeking legal avenues to silence their critics. In a case called <em>Cordova v. Huneault</em>, the proprietor of \"Denver Metro Audits\" is suing the proprietor of \"Frauditor Troll Channel\" for clipping the former's videos for \"reaction videos.\"</p>\n<p>One of the plaintiff's claims here is that the defendant violated Section 1201 of the DMCA by saving videos from Youtube. They argue that Youtube's javascript obfuscator (a \"rolling cipher\") is an \"effective access control\" under the statute. Magistrate Judge Virginia K DeMarchi (Northern District of California) agreed with the plaintiff:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/images/Cordova-v.-Huneault-25-cv-04685-VKD-Order-on-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf\">https://torrentfreak.com/images/Cordova-v.-Huneault-25-cv-04685-VKD-Order-on-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf</a></p>\n<p>As Torrentfreak reports, this ruling \"gives creators who want to sue rivals an option to sue for more than just simple copyright infringement\":</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/ripping-clips-for-youtube-reaction-videos-can-violate-the-dmca-court-rules/\">https://torrentfreak.com/ripping-clips-for-youtube-reaction-videos-can-violate-the-dmca-court-rules/</a></p>\n<p>Remember, DMCA 1201 applies <em>whether or not you infringe someone's copyright</em>. It is a blanket prohibition on the circumvention of <em>any</em> \"effective access control\" for <em>any</em> copyrighted work, even when no one's rights are being violated. It's a way to transform otherwise lawful conduct into a felony. It's what Jay Freeman calls \"Felony contempt of business model.\"</p>\n<p>If the higher court upholds this magistrate judge's ruling, then <em>all</em> clipping becomes a crime, and the subjects of criticism will have a ready tool to silence any critic. This obliterates fair use, wipes it off the statute-book. It welds shut copyright's escape valve for free expression.</p>\n<p>Now, it's true that the US Copyright Office holds hearings every three years where it grants exemptions to DMCA 1201, and it has indeed granted an exemption for ripping video for critical and educational purposes. But this process is deceptive! The exemptions that the Copyright Office grants are \"use exemptions\" &#8211; they allow you to \"make the use.\" However, they are not \"tools exemptions\" &#8211; they do not give you permission to acquire or share the tool <em>needed</em> to make the use:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/28/mcbroken/#my-milkshake-brings-all-the-lawyers-to-the-yard\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/28/mcbroken/#my-milkshake-brings-all-the-lawyers-to-the-yard</a></p>\n<p>Which means that you are allowed to rip a stream, but you're not allowed to use a stream-ripping service. If Youtube's rolling cipher is an \"effective access control\" then all of those stream-ripping services are wildly illegal, felonies carrying a five-year sentence and a $500k fine for a first offense under DMCA 1201.</p>\n<p>Under the US Copyright Office's exemption process, if you want to make a reaction video, then you, <em>personally</em> must create your own stream-ripper. You are not allowed to discuss how to do this with anyone else, and you can't share your stream-ripper with anyone else, and if you do, you've committed a felony.</p>\n<p>So this is a catastrophic ruling. If it stands, it will make the production of video essays, reaction videos, and other critical videos into a legal minefield, by giving everyone whose video is clipped and criticized a means to threaten their critics with long prison sentences, fair use be damned. The only people who will safely be able to make this kind of critical video are skilled programmers who can personally defeat Youtube's \"rolling cipher.\" And unlike claims about stream-ripping violating Youtube's terms of service &#8211; which can only be brought by Youtube &#8211; DMCA 1201 claims can be brought by <em>anyone</em> whose videos get clipped and criticized.</p>\n<p>Is Youtube's rolling cipher an \"effective access control?\" Well, <em>I</em> don't know how to bypass it, but there are <em>dozens</em> of services that have independently figured out how to get around it. That seems like good evidence that the access control is <em>not</em> \"effective.\"</p>\n<p>When the DMCA was enacted in 1998, this is <em>exactly</em> the kind of thing experts warned would happen:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/13/ctrl-ctrl-ctrl/#free-dmitry\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/13/ctrl-ctrl-ctrl/#free-dmitry</a></p>\n<p>And here we are, more than a quarter-century later, living in the prison of lawmakers' reckless disregard for evidence and expertise, a world where criticism can be converted into a felony.

    "content": "<p>Every package manager faces the same core problem: given a set of packages with version constraints, find a compatible set of versions to install. The classic example is the diamond dependency: A depends on B and C, both of which depend on D but at incompatible versions. The resolver has to find a version of D that satisfies both, prove that none exists, or find some other way out. Di Cosmo et al. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278629134_EDOS_deliverable_WP2-D21_Report_on_Formal_Management_of_Software_Dependencies\">proved in 2005</a> that this problem is NP-complete, encoding it as 3SAT for Debian and RPM constraint languages. In practice, real-world dependency graphs are far more tractable than the worst case, and different ecosystems have landed on different resolution strategies that make different tradeoffs between completeness, speed, error quality, and simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>These approaches fall roughly into complete solvers (SAT, PubGrub, ASP), heuristic solvers (backtracking, Molinillo, system resolvers), constraint relaxation strategies (deduplication with nesting, version mediation), and approaches that avoid the problem entirely (minimal version selection, content-addressed stores).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/2025/12/29/categorizing-package-manager-clients.html\">categorizing package manager clients</a> post lists which package managers use which approach. The <a href=\"/2025/11/13/package-management-papers.html\">package management papers</a> post has the full bibliography. The <a href=\"https://github.com/ecosyste-ms/package-manager-resolvers\">package-manager-resolvers</a> repo has per-ecosystem detail and comparison tables.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sat-solving\">SAT solving</h3>\n\n<p>Encode version constraints as a boolean satisfiability problem. Each package-version pair becomes a boolean variable, and dependencies and conflicts become clauses. A SAT solver then searches for an assignment where all clauses are satisfied. If one exists, you get a compatible install set. If none exists, the solver can prove it, which is something simpler algorithms cannot do.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/papers/opium.pdf\">OPIUM paper</a> (Tucker et al. 2007) was the first to build a complete dependency solver this way, combining SAT with pseudo-boolean optimization and Integer Linear Programming. They showed that in simulated upgrade scenarios, 23.3% of Debian users encountered cases where apt-get’s incomplete heuristics failed to find valid solutions that existed. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121212000477\">Di Cosmo et al. (2012)</a> later argued that dependency solving should be separated from the rest of the package manager entirely, using generic external solvers rather than ad-hoc heuristics baked into each tool.</p>\n\n<p>SAT solving is computationally expensive in theory but modern solvers handle real-world package instances well. The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07851\">Still Hard retrospective</a> (Abate et al. 2020) confirmed that SAT-based approaches are gaining adoption and that practical solvers perform well despite the NP-completeness result. More recent work by <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00124\">Pinckney et al. (2023)</a> builds on this with a Max-SMT formulation that extends SAT with optimization objectives, providing a unified formulation where soft constraints (preferences like “prefer newer versions”) and hard constraints (compatibility requirements) coexist naturally rather than being bolted on after the fact.</p>\n\n<p>Used by Composer, DNF, Conda/Mamba (via libsolv), Zypper (via libsolv), and opam (via built-in CUDF solver mccs, with optional external solvers). libsolv implements CDCL with watched literals, the same core algorithm as MiniSat, but adds domain-specific optimizations for package management that make it faster in practice.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pubgrub\">PubGrub</h3>\n\n<p>PubGrub is a variant of conflict-driven clause learning (the technique behind modern SAT solvers) designed specifically for version solving. It’s conceptually SAT-like but operationally domain-specific, replacing generic clause structures with version ranges and incompatibility records that map directly to the problem. Its key advantage is the UX of failure. Before PubGrub, “unsolvable dependency conflict” was a dead end that left developers guessing which constraint to relax. PubGrub tracks exactly which incompatibilities caused the failure and produces human-readable explanations, turning a resolution error into something closer to a task list.</p>\n\n<p>Natalie Weizenbaum created PubGrub for Dart’s pub package manager and <a href=\"https://nex3.medium.com/pubgrub-2fb6470504f\">described the algorithm in 2018</a>. The algorithm maintains a set of incompatibilities (facts about which version combinations cannot coexist) and uses unit propagation and conflict-driven learning to narrow the search. When it hits a dead end, it derives a new incompatibility from the conflict, which both prunes the search space and records the reason for future error reporting.</p>\n\n<p>Poetry, uv, Swift Package Manager, Hex, and Bundler (which migrated from Molinillo) all use PubGrub now. The adoption story is partly about the algorithm and partly about the availability of quality implementations in multiple languages: <a href=\"https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub\">pubgrub-rs</a> in Rust (used by uv), <a href=\"https://github.com/jhawthorn/pub_grub\">pub_grub</a> in Ruby (used by Bundler), Poetry’s internal solver in Python, and <a href=\"https://github.com/hexpm/hex_solver\">hex_solver</a> in Elixir. Having reusable libraries matters as much as the theoretical properties; a better algorithm that nobody can embed doesn’t get adopted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"backtracking\">Backtracking</h3>\n\n<p>The simplest approach: try versions in preference order (usually newest first), recurse into dependencies, and back up when you hit a conflict. No encoding step, no external solver, just depth-first search with rollback.</p>\n\n<p>Backtracking works well when the dependency graph is reasonably constrained, which covers most real-world cases. It struggles with pathological inputs where conflicts hide deep in the tree and the solver wastes time exploring doomed branches before discovering the root cause. Justin Cappos <a href=\"https://www.cs.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/TR08-04.pdf\">documented this approach</a> in the Stork dissertation, noting that despite its simplicity, it worked well in practice for their adopters.</p>\n\n<p>pip (via resolvelib), Cargo, and Cabal use backtracking. In practice the line between “backtracking” and “SAT-like” is blurry: modern backtracking solvers often add learning and backjumping, where the solver records which choices caused a conflict and skips irrelevant decisions when backing up. Cabal’s solver does both, which helps significantly on Haskell’s deep dependency trees. At that point you’re doing much of what PubGrub does, just without the structured incompatibility tracking that produces good error messages.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"asp-solving\">ASP solving</h3>\n\n<p>Answer Set Programming expresses the entire resolution problem as a logic program and lets a general-purpose ASP solver find valid models. Where SAT works with boolean variables and clauses, ASP works with rules and constraints in a declarative language closer to the problem domain.</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly suited to HPC, where “which versions are compatible” is only part of the problem. Spack needs to reason about compiler versions, build variants (debug/release, MPI implementations, GPU backends), microarchitecture targets, and build options alongside version constraints. Encoding all of that in SAT would be painful. In ASP, each constraint type maps naturally to rules. <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3571885.3571931\">Gamblin et al. (2022)</a> describe Spack’s ASP encoding and how they structure optimization criteria to mix source and binary builds by reusing existing installations when compatible.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.65.2\">aspcud solver</a> (Gebser et al. 2011) was the first to apply ASP to package dependency solving, demonstrating competitive performance on Debian package problems with the benefit of declarative optimization criteria. Spack uses Clingo as its ASP solver, encoding the full concretization problem (versions, compilers, variants, targets) as a logic program.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"minimal-version-selection\">Minimal version selection</h3>\n\n<p>Pick the oldest version that satisfies each constraint rather than the newest. This makes resolution deterministic and reproducible without a lockfile: the same go.mod always produces the same versions, because there is only one valid answer. Russ Cox designed this for Go modules and <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs\">wrote extensively about it</a>, including <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/version-sat\">why the SAT problem doesn’t apply</a> when you choose minimum versions. The intuition: if every constraint names a minimum and you always pick that minimum, the search space collapses to a single candidate per package with no backtracking needed. What was a search problem becomes a graph traversal.</p>\n\n<p>The tradeoff is that you get “known good” rather than “latest compatible.” When a dependency releases a new version with a bug fix you need, you must explicitly bump your requirement rather than getting it automatically. Cox’s argument is that this predictability is worth more than automatic upgrades, and that automatic upgrades cause more subtle breakage than they prevent. His <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3329781.3344149\">Surviving Software Dependencies</a> essay (2019) makes the broader case.</p>\n\n<p>Go modules and vcpkg both use minimal version selection, with vcpkg’s approach explicitly modelled on Go’s.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"deduplication-with-nesting\">Deduplication with nesting</h3>\n\n<p>A constraint relaxation strategy rather than a resolution algorithm. Instead of requiring one version of each package across the whole dependency tree, allow multiple versions when different dependents need incompatible ranges. If package A needs lodash@3 and package B needs lodash@4, install both and wire each to its own copy.</p>\n\n<p>This avoids resolution failure by relaxing the single-version constraint. The cost is disk space and, more subtly, runtime complexity: multiple copies of the same library mean multiple copies of its global state, so two modules that think they’re sharing a singleton or checking <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">instanceof</code> against the same class can silently disagree. npm, Yarn, and pnpm all use this approach, with varying strategies for flattening the tree to reduce duplication while preserving correctness. npm’s hoisting algorithm tries to lift shared-compatible versions to the top of node_modules so they’re shared, only nesting when versions actually conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Cargo does a limited form: it allows one version per semver-compatible range (one per major version, or one per minor if pre-1.0), so <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">foo 1.2</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">foo 1.3</code> unify but <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">foo 1.x</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">foo 2.x</code> can coexist.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"version-mediation\">Version mediation</h3>\n\n<p>No solver at all. When two dependencies require different versions of the same package, the build tool picks a winner by convention. Maven uses nearest-definition (the version declared closest to the root of the dependency tree wins). Gradle uses highest-version. NuGet uses lowest-applicable.</p>\n\n<p>This is fast and predictable but can silently break things. If the “winner” version is incompatible with what the “loser” dependency actually needs, you get runtime errors rather than a resolution failure at install time. Maven in particular is notorious for this: a transitive dependency quietly gets a different version than it was tested with, and you find out when something throws a NoSuchMethodError. Gradle’s “highest version wins” sounds safer until you realize it can pull in a major version bump transitively, breaking API compatibility for a dependency that never asked for it. In some cases that’s worse than Maven’s behaviour, since at least Maven’s nearest-definition tends to keep you closer to versions that were explicitly chosen.</p>\n\n<p>Maven, Gradle, NuGet, sbt, and Ivy all use version mediation. In the Clojure ecosystem, Leiningen uses Maven’s nearest-definition algorithm via Aether, while tools.deps picks the newest version instead.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"molinillo\">Molinillo</h3>\n\n<p>A backtracking solver with heuristics tuned for Ruby’s ecosystem, maintained by the CocoaPods team. <a href=\"https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo\">Molinillo</a> tracks the state of resolution as a directed graph and uses heuristics about which package to resolve next to avoid unnecessary backtracking.</p>\n\n<p>RubyGems and CocoaPods use Molinillo. Bundler used it for years before switching to PubGrub, partly for better error messages when resolution fails.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"system-package-resolution\">System package resolution</h3>\n\n<p>System package managers have a structural advantage that simplifies resolution: within a given repository or suite, there’s typically only one version of each package available. Debian stable doesn’t offer you a choice between openssl 1.1 and openssl 3.0; the suite maintainers already made that decision. As I wrote about in the <a href=\"/2026/02/06/cratesio-freaky-friday.html\">Crates.io’s Freaky Friday</a> post, this collapses what would be a version selection problem into something closer to a compatibility check. The resolver still has real work to do, but the search space is radically smaller than what language-level resolvers face with thousands of candidate versions per package.</p>\n\n<p>What system resolvers handle instead are constraints that language-level tools don’t encounter: file conflicts between packages, virtual packages, architecture-specific dependencies, and triggers that run during installation. The virtual packages concept has no real equivalent in language package managers. When a Debian package declares <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Provides: mail-transport-agent</code>, any of postfix, exim4, or sendmail can satisfy that dependency. The resolver has to pick one, and the choice interacts with the rest of the installed system in ways that a language-level resolver never faces, since removing one mail transport agent to install another can break unrelated packages that assumed it was there.</p>\n\n<p>apt uses a scoring-based approach with immediate resolution, evaluating candidate solutions against user preferences (minimize removals, prefer already-installed versions). It processes dependencies greedily rather than searching for a global optimum, which is why it occasionally proposes removing half your desktop environment to install a library. aptitude added backtracking on top of apt’s dependency handling, which produces better solutions but is slower. apt’s internal solver has grown more capable over time, and aptitude can optionally use external CUDF solvers for harder upgrade scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>RPM-based systems (Fedora, openSUSE, RHEL) use libsolv, which gives them genuinely complete resolution. DNF and Zypper encode the full RPM dependency model including weak dependencies (Recommends, Suggests, Supplements, Enhances) that were added in RPM 4.12. These let packages express optional relationships without hard failures when they can’t be satisfied, which matters for minimal container installs where you want a stripped-down system without pulling in documentation or GUI toolkits.</p>\n\n<p>pacman resolves dependencies but doesn’t handle conflicts with a full solver, relying instead on Arch’s packaging policy of avoiding library version conflicts in the first place. The whole repository is meant to be installable together, so the resolver’s job is mostly topological sorting rather than constraint satisfaction. apk (Alpine) is similar in philosophy but adds a rollback mechanism that can undo failed upgrades atomically.</p>\n\n<p>Portage (Gentoo) has a harder problem than most because packages are built from source with USE flags that control compile-time features, the dependency graph changes shape depending on which flags are set. Enabling the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">qt</code> USE flag on one package can pull in dozens of new dependencies. Portage resolves this with a backtracking solver that re-evaluates the graph when USE flag changes propagate, but the interaction between USE flags and dependencies means users sometimes hit circular dependencies that require manual intervention. FreeBSD ports and pkgsrc face similar source-build resolution challenges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"content-addressed--explicit\">Content-addressed / explicit</h3>\n\n<p>Nix and Guix side-step the version resolution problem entirely. Every package is identified by a hash of all its inputs: source code, build dependencies, compiler flags, everything. There is no “which version of openssl should I pick” because each package explicitly pins its exact dependencies by hash. Two packages can depend on different versions of the same library without conflict because the versions live at different paths in the store, identified by different hashes.</p>\n\n<p>This gives you reproducibility by construction rather than by lockfile, but it trades solver complexity for maintainer complexity. Instead of a resolver finding a compatible path through the version graph, a human (or a tool like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">niv</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nix-init</code>) must explicitly define every input. The failure mode shifts too: instead of runtime breakage from incompatible versions, you get human fatigue from maintaining explicit input sets across a large package collection. Builds are slower because there’s less sharing of intermediate artifacts than in version-based systems; if two packages differ in any input, they get separate builds even when the output would be identical. The Nix expression language has a steep learning curve compared to a TOML manifest. And the store grows large, though <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nix-store --optimise</code> (which deduplicates identical files via hardlinks) and content-addressed derivations (which hash outputs rather than inputs, enabling more sharing) are closing that gap.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"resolution-libraries\">Resolution libraries</h3>\n\n<p>Reusable libraries that package managers can embed rather than writing their own solver.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub\">PubGrub</a> (Rust) - Conflict-driven solver producing human-readable error messages.

This is his first piece since 2023, and we’re happy to have him back on here once again. I’ll be back at the bottom of the piece with some interesting links. Anyway, over to Andrew:</em></p><p><strong>A favorite pastime of tourists</strong> visiting New York City is learning the names and locations of various, usually famous, neighborhoods. They often get them wrong, but when in Rome it helps to speak some Latin. Some neighborhoods are pretty well-defined, like TriBeca and SoHo. Many others are not.</p><p>Take the area just north of the United Nations Headquarters, as an example. This area, north of 43rd Street and south of 53rd, and bordered by the East River and Lexington Avenue to the west, is understandably home to many diplomats and support staff for the United Nations. Permanent missions and consuls dot the area. Most commonly known as Turtle Bay, the name does change with slight boundary variations. And, of course, areas change over time.</p><p>This part of Manhattan saw its first European settlement in the 1600s as a Dutch farm. During the American Revolution, British General William Howe established his headquarters in the area. It was here that Nathan Hale, spy and hero of the Independence movement, said his famous,<br>\npossibly apocryphal, last words, “I regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.” Last words are not the only aspect of Hale’s life in dispute, as the exact location of his death is not known either, but it is immortalized on First Avenue between 49th and 50th.</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/oOsfqKMmqqXtzbrCPS37Jghf558=/1000x1333/filters:quality(80)/uploads/plaque1.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1333\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"plaque1.jpg\" /><figcaption>(Photos by Andrew Egan)</figcaption></figure><p>After the war and into the 19th and 20th centuries, Turtle Bay would develop heavy industries, such as power generation and animal processing, alongside tenements and brownstones. Before the neighborhood became the capital of international diplomacy, it was home to elite entertainers, specifically Broadway composers.</p><p>Where the neighborhood’s past and present collide is at the end of East 50th Street, currently home of the Consul and Permanent Mission to the United Nations of Luxembourg. But from 1947 to 1989, it was the home of famed songwriter Irving Berlin. This is where he wrote such staples of the American songbook as “White Christmas”, “Puttin’ on the Ritz”, “Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)”.</p><p><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/aQMX5L7OGvcvPvtZu1TN5kAd9_s=/1000x750/filters:quality(80)/uploads/plaque2.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"plaque2.jpg\" /></p><p>Noted Broadway luminaries such as Cole Porter and Stephen Sondheim lived in the area during their most productive periods. Porter had rather lux accommodations living in the Waldorf Towers on East 50th Street for nearly 30 years until he died in 1964. Sondheim purchased a rowhouse at 246 East 49th Street with the proceeds of his first hit musical, <a href=\"https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/stephen-sondheim-residence/\">later referring to it</a> as “the house that <em>Gypsy</em> built”.</p><p>Why this area became home to so many Broadway composers makes sense in hindsight. The neighborhood was relatively suburban compared with downtown Manhattan. Commercial real estate in Midtown did not gain momentum in earnest until after World War II, with significant growth occurring in the 1950s and 1960s. However, iconic buildings like the Chrysler and Empire State buildings were already erected in the 1930s. Commutes were also short as Turtle Bay is within walking distance to Times Square, home to many of Broadways most prominent venues.</p><p>The proximity to peers and colleagues also allowed members of the Broadway community to socialize and host members of New York’s broader arts community. It was in this context that a largely forgotten, but successful at the time, composer would make their most lasting contribution to American art.</p></div><div class=\"adlayout ad-patreon\"><div class=\"md:grid md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 items-start gap-8\"><div class=\"md:col-span-1 max-w-[300px]\"><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" class=\"block hover:no-underline\"><img src=\"https://static.tedium.co/uploads/kofi_logo.png\" alt=\"… You?\" class=\"w-full h-auto max-w-[300px] m-0\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></div><div class=\"md:col-span-2 lg:col-span-3\"><h5 class=\"text-xl font-bold mb-2\" style=\"background-color: var(--ad-accent)\"><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" class=\"block hover:no-underline\"> Sponsored By … You? </a></h5><div class=\"adcopy !max-w-none\"><p><strong>If you find weird or unusual topics</strong> like this super-fascinating, the best way to tell us is to <strong><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tedium\">give us a nod on Ko-Fi</a></strong>.

Here is another one just outside a restaurant on 50th Street and First Avenue, commemorating a scene filmed at the location for the landmark film The French Connection.</figcaption></figure><h3>The mostly forgotten performer who gifted an iconic author the gift of time</h3><p>Michael Brown was born in Marfa, Texas in 1920. After attending the University of Texas at Austin and receiving a master’s in English literature from the University of Virginia, Brown enlisted in the Army in 1944. When not fulfilling his military duties, he wrote and performed songs. He moved to New York in 1946 after his discharge, where he became known as a cabaret performer, composer, and lyricist.</p><p>The post-war era of American live theater was experimenting with form and medium. Some of Brown’s earliest Broadway work appeared on stage and was filmed for nationwide theatrical release. This period overlapped with America’s post-war economic boom (for nearly a decade following the war, the US accounted for approximately 50 percent of <em>global</em> GDP) while NYC cemented its status as a financial and corporate hub. With outsized profits, these bankers and corporations decided to spend quite a bit of money on the local Broadway scene.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/arts/music/michael-brown-whose-industrial-musicals-gave-wings-to-to-kill-a-mockingbird-dies-at-93.html\">In Brown’s 2014 <em>New York Times</em> obituary</a>, they note, “At midcentury, many American corporations put on Broadway-style musical extravaganzas for their employees. Typically staged for just a performance or two at sales conferences and managerial meetings and occasionally recorded for posterity, the shows were meant to rally the troops…”</p><p>These weren’t the employee-organized skits at modern corporate retreats. Not only did these productions feature professional casts, like Florence Henderson later of “The Brady Bunch” fame, but also much larger budgets than traditional Broadway musicals. A typical production might cost $500,000 at this time, but “industrial musicals”, as they would become known, might have budgets as high as $3 million.</p><p>The <em>Times</em> obituary would note Brown’s sincere effort when crafting his industrial musicals. A particularly delightful passage from “Love Song to an Electrolux” goes:</p><blockquote><p>This is the perfect matchment</p><p>All sweet and serene.</p><p>I’ve formed an attachment</p><p>I’m in love with a lovely machine.</p></blockquote><p>Michael Brown’s magnum opus would come with “Wonderful World of Chemistry”, a musical written for the Du Pont pavilion at the 1964 World’s Fair. The 24-minute musical was performed some 40 times a day and was seen by an estimated five million people for nearly 17,000 performances. The longest-running traditional Broadway musical, “The Phantom of the Opera”, closed in 2023 with a little more than 13,000 performances.</p><p>By the mid-1950s, Brown and his wife, Joy, had become established members of the NYC Broadway set. They hosted and attended gatherings across Turtle Bay and Manhattan. Their townhouse is just down 50th Street, within eyesight of Irving Berlin’s famed residence. It would not be Brown’s considerable musical talent that would be his lasting contribution to American arts. Oddly enough, it would be his and wife Joy’s graciousness that would be remembered.</p><p>In 1954, Brown contributed lyrics to a Broadway musical called “House of Flowers” with music by Harold Arlen and a book by a young writer named Truman Capote.</p><p>Capote would become famous globally and infamous in Manhattan for his socializing and gossip. But in the mid-1950s, he had yet to find his big break and still spent a fair amount of time with a childhood friend from his native Alabama.</p><p>She moved to New York in 1956 to become a writer. The reality was she had bills to pay, so she got a job as an airline reservations clerk. She hung out with Truman and his growing circle of artist friends when she could, occasionally working on a novel when she had time. Sometime in 1956, she met Michael and Joy Brown.</p><p>The couple took a liking to the aspiring writer, inviting her over for dinner regularly, leading to a Christmas invitation in 1956. The Browns had had a decent year financially. In the fall, Michael had produced a musical fashion show for Esquire magazine. With the profits, the Browns decided to give her a gift.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2025/12/06/harper-lee-christmas-gift-essay/\">In a 1961 essay</a>, she remembers seeing an envelope with her name on it in the branches of the Brown’s Christmas tree, “I opened it and read; ‘You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.’”</p><p>The rough draft for what would eventually be titled “To Kill a Mockingbird”, was finished by the spring of 1957 but would undergo significant rewrites until its publication in 1960. Harper Lee won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961 and would not publish another book until shortly before she died in 2016.</p><p>The exact details of the Brown’s supporting role in Harper Lee’s career <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/arts/music/michael-brown-whose-industrial-musicals-gave-wings-to-to-kill-a-mockingbird-dies-at-93.html\">were largely kept secret</a> for nearly 50 years. A 2006 biography revealed that Lee insisted the gift be a loan, which Michael Brown said had been repaid long ago.</p><p>Lee admits to thinking it was a “fantastic gamble” but that Michael Brown reassured her by saying, “No honey. It’s not a risk. It’s a sure thing.”</p><p>Ms. Brown recalled to the <em>Times</em> the couple’s astonishment when they heard Lee’s publisher was ordering 5,000 copies for the novel’s first run. She remembers thinking, “Who in the world is going to buy 5,000 copies?”</p><p>HarperCollins, the book’s current publisher, says “To Kill a Mockingbird” has sold 30 million copies in 40 languages worldwide.</p><p>If this is where you expect a picture of the plaque commemorating Michael Brown or Harper Lee at the house on East 50th Street, well, there isn’t one. In a neighborhood that celebrates vague historical locations and recent pop culture, it is sort of odd that the Brown’s contributions to the arts aren’t more publicly celebrated.</p><p>New York is riddled with such stories. Some have inspired developers to create arbitrary neighborhood names to boost marketing appeal and raise rents.</p><p>In 2017, developers attempted to rebrand the area between 110th and 125th Streets, which is Harlem, as SoHa, or South Harlem. Residents were understandably furious and roundly rejected the move.</p><p>“How dare someone try to rob our culture, and try to act as if we were not here, and create a new name, a new reality as if the clock started when other people showed up?” one state legislator representing the area said at the time.</p><p>Bypassing the rather large and contentious topic of gentrification, the move to rename one of the most famous neighborhoods in the world was just stupid. Especially considering how ill-defined many NYC neighborhoods are in reality. Maybe the easiest way to define any area is by what happened there.</p><p>Beyond Michael Brown’s success and Harper Lee’s nascent talent, another element was vital in bringing them together: Turtle Bay. It was here that artists built their lives atop the history of Dutch farmers, British generals, and butchers. While his musical achievements have become a footnote from the golden era of Broadway, Michael and Joy Brown’s dedication to art followed that success. Without Du Pont or Electrolux or Esquire, and the eternal corporate desire to motivate employees with anything other than increased pay, the Brown’s would not have been able to be modest patrons. Without that support, perhaps “To Kill a Mockingbird” would be published a few years later, or not at all.</p><p>Artists created a neighborhood while delighting audiences from around the world just a few blocks away. They invited up-and-coming talent into their homes for dinner, drinks, and good conversation. And every once in a while, they funded new work that would change the world.</p></div><div class=\"graybox\"><h5>Gifted Links (From Ernie)</h5><p><strong>So the Washington Post,</strong> a company that formerly employed me before Jeff Bezos entered the picture, got gutted this week.
