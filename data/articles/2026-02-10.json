What can the opposition party do without majorities in either house? Well, they could start by refusing to continue to fund ICE, a masked thug snatch/murder squad that roams our streets, killing with impunity:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273\">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-sprawling-spending-package-democrats-split-ice-funding-rcna255273</a></p>\n<p>That's table stakes. What would a <em>real</em> political response to fascism look like? Again, it wouldn't stop with banning masks for ICE goons, or even requiring them to wear QR codes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345\">https://gizmodo.com/dem-congressman-wants-to-make-ice-agents-wear-qr-codes-2000710345</a></p>\n<p>Though it should be noted that ICE hates this idea, and that ICE agents wear masks because they fear consequences for their sadistic criminality:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/0LNh8\">https://archive.is/0LNh8</a></p>\n<p>This despite the fact that the (criminally culpable) Vice President has assured them that they have absolute impunity, no matter who they kill:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis\">https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis</a></p>\n<p>The fact that ICE agents worry about consequences despite Vance's assurances suggests ways that Dems could \"meet the moment.\"</p>\n<p>I think Dems should start a Nuremberg Caucus, named for the Nazi war-crimes trials that followed from the defeat of German fascists and the death of their leader:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials</a></p>\n<p>What would this caucus do? Well, it could have a public website where it assembled and organized the evidence for the trials that the Democrats could promise to bring after the Trump regime falls. Each fresh outrage, each statement, each video-clip &#8211; whether of Trump officials or of his shock-troops &#8211; could be neatly slotted in, given an exhibit number, and annotated with the criminal and civil violations captured in the evidence.</p>\n<p>The caucus could publish dates these trials will be held on &#8211; following from Jan 20, 2029 &#8211; and even which courtrooms each official, high and low, will be tried in. These dates could be changed as new crimes emerge, making sure the most egregious offenses are always at the top of the agenda. Each trial would have a witness list.</p>\n<p>The Nuremberg Caucus could vow to repurpose ICE's $75b budget to pursue Trump's crimes, from corruption to civil rights violations to labor violations to environmental violations. It could announce its intent to fully fund the FTC and DoJ Antitrust Division to undertake scrutiny of all mergers approved under Trump, and put corporations on notice that they should expect lengthy, probing inquiries into any mergers they undertake between now and the fall of Trumpism. Who knows, perhaps some shareholders will demand that management hold off on mergers in anticipation of this lookback scrutiny, and if not, perhaps they will sue executives after the FTC and DoJ go to work.</p>\n<p>While they're at it, the Nuremberg Caucus could publish a plan to hire thousands of <em>IRS</em> agents (paid for by taxing billionaires and zeroing out ICE's budget) who will focus exclusively on the ultra-wealthy and especially any supernormal wealth gains coinciding with the second Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>Money talks. ICE agents are signing up with the promise of $50k hiring bonuses and $60k in student debt cancellation. That's peanuts. The Nuremberg Caucus could announce a Crimestoppers-style program with $1m bounties for any ICE officer who a) is themselves innocent of any human rights violations, and; b) provides evidence leading to the conviction of another ICE officer for committing human rights violations. That would certainly improve morale for (some) ICE officers.</p>\n<p>Critics of this plan will say that this will force Trump officials to try to steal the next election in order to avoid consequences for their actions. This is certainly true: confidence in a \"peaceful transfer of power\" is the bedrock of any kind of fair election.</p>\n<p>But this bunch have already <em>repeatedly</em> signaled that they intend to steal the midterms and the next general election:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html\">https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/top-senate-republican-rejects-trumps-shocking-election-plan-i-think-thats-a-constitutional-issue.html</a></p>\n<p>ICE agents are straight up telling people that ICE is on the streets to arrest people in Democratic-leaning states (\"The more people that you lose in Minnesota, you then lose a voting right to stay blue\"):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/\">https://unicornriot.ninja/2026/federal-agent-in-coon-rapids-the-more-people-that-you-lose-in-minnesota-you-then-lose-a-voting-right-to-stay-blue/</a></p>\n<p>The only path to fair elections &#8211; and saving America &#8211; lies through mobilizing and energizing hundreds of millions of Americans. They are ready. They are <em>begging</em> for leadership. They want an electoral <em>choice</em>, something better than a return to the pre-Trump status quo. If you want giant crowds at every polling place, rising up against ICE and DHS voter-suppression, then you have to promise people that their vote will <em>mean</em> something.</p>\n<p>Dems have to pick a side. That means being against anyone who is for fascism &#8211; including other Dems. The Nuremberg Caucus should denounce the disgusting child abuse perpetrated by the Trump regime:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children\">https://www.propublica.org/article/life-inside-ice-dilley-children</a></p>\n<p>But they should also denounce Democrats who vote to fund that abuse:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html\">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fetterman-shutdown-dhs-ice-senate-b2916350.html</a></p>\n<p>The people of Minneapolis (and elsewhere) have repeatedly proven that we outnumber fascists by a huge margin. Dems need to stop demoralizing their base by doing nothing and start demonstrating that they understand the urgency of this crisis.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\n<h1 heds=\"0\">Hey

    "title": "A fun Python puzzle with circular imports",
    "link": "https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PythonCircularImportPuzzle",
    "content": "<div class=\"wikitext\"><p><a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@bmispelon\">Baptiste Mispelon</a> asked <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@bmispelon/116041593220352595\">an\ninteresting Python quiz</a>\n(<a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@treyhunner/116041923791357383\">via</a>,\nvia <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@glyph\">@glyph</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Can someone explain this #Python import behavior? <br>\nI'm in a directory with 3 files:</p>\n\n<p>a.py contains `A = 1; from b import *` <br>\nb.py contains `from a import *; A += 1` <br>\nc.py contains `from a import A; print(A)` <br>\n</p>\n\n<p>Can you guess and explain what happens when you run `python c.py`?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I encourage you to guess which of the options in <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@bmispelon/116041593220352595\">the original\npost</a> is\nthe actual behavior before you read the rest of this entry.</p>\n\n<p>There are two things going on here. The first thing is <a href=\"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/FromImportBindingIssue\">what\nactually happens when you do '<code>from module import ...</code>'</a>. The short version is that this copies\n<a href=\"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/WhatVariablesMean\">the current bindings of names</a> from one module\nto another. So when module b does '<code>from a import *</code>', it copies\nthe binding of a.A to b.A and then the <code>+=</code> changes that binding.\nThe behavior would be the same if we used '<code>from a import A</code>' and\n'<code>from b import A</code>' in the code, and if we did we could describe\nwhat each did in isolation as starting with '<code>A = 1</code>' (in a), then\n'<code>A = a.A; A += 2</code>' (in b), and then '<code>A = b.A</code>' (back in a)\nsuccessively (and then in c, '<code>A = a.A</code>').</p>\n\n<p>The second thing going on is that you can import incomplete modules\n(this is true in both Python 2 and Python 3, which return the same\nresults here). To see how this works we need to combine <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement\">the\ndescription of '<code>import</code>' and '<code>from</code>'</a>\nand <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#loading\">the approximation of what happens during loading a module</a>, although\nneither is completely precise. To summarize, when a module is being\nloaded, the first thing that happens is that a module namespace is\ncreated and is added to <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules\"><code>sys.modules</code></a>; then the\ncode of the module is executed in that namespace. When Python\nencounters a '<code>from</code>', if there is an entry for the module in\n<code>sys.modules</code>, Python immediately imports things from it; it\nimplicitly assumes that the module is already fully loaded.</p>\n\n<p>At first I was surprised by this behavior, but the more I think\nabout it the more it seems a reasonable choice. It avoids having\nto explicitly detect circular imports and it makes circular imports\nwork in the simple case (where you do '<code>import b</code>' and then don't\nuse anything from b until all imports are finished and the program\nis running). It has the cost that if you have circular name uses\nyou get an unhelpful error message about 'cannot import name' (or\n'NameError: name ... is not defined' if you use '<code>from module\nimport *</code>'):</p>\n\n<blockquote><pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">\n$ cat a.py\nfrom b import B; A = 10 + B\n$ cat b.py\nfrom a import A; B = 20 + A\n$ cat c.py\nfrom a import A; print(A)\n$ python c.py\n[...]\nImportError: cannot import name 'A' from 'a' [...]\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Python 3.13 does print a nice stack trace the points to the whole set\nof 'from ...' statements.)</p>\n\n<p>Given all of this, here is what I believe is the sequence of execution\nin <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@bmispelon/116041593220352595\">Baptiste Mispelon's example</a>:</p>\n\n<ol><li>c.py does '<code>from a import A</code>', which initiates a load of the '<code>a</code>'\nmodule.</li>\n<li>an '<code>a</code>' module is created and added to <code>sys.modules</code></li>\n<li>that module begins executing the code from a.py, which creates an\n'<code>a.A</code>' name (bound to 1) and then does '<code>from b import *</code>'.</li>\n<li>a '<code>b</code>' module is created and added to <code>sys.modules</code>.</li>\n<li>that module begins executing the code from b.py. This code starts\nby doing '<code>from a import *</code>', which finds that\n'<code>sys.modules[\"a\"]</code>' exists and copies the a.A name binding,\ncreating <code>b.A</code> (bound to 1).</li>\n<li>b.py does '<code>A += 1</code>', which mutates the <code>b.A</code> binding (but not the\nseparate <code>a.A</code> binding) to be '2'.</li>\n<li>b.py finishes its code, returning control to the code from a.py,\nwhich is still part way through '<code>from b import *</code>'. This import\ncopies all names (and their bindings) from <code>sys.modules[\"b\"]</code> into\nthe 'a' module, which means the <code>b.A</code> binding (to 2) overwrites\nthe old <code>a.A</code> binding (to 1).</li>\n<li>a.py finishes and returns control to c.py, where '<code>from a import A</code>' \ncan now complete by copying the <code>a.A</code> name and its binding into 'c',\nmake it the equivalent of 'import a; A = a.A; del a'.</li>\n<li>c.py prints the value of this, which is 2.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At the end of things, there is all of c.A, a.A, and b.A, and they\nare bindings to the same object. The order of binding was 'b.A =\n2; a.A = b.A; c.A = a.A'.</p>\n\n<p>(There's also <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@bmispelon/116041651512905642\">a bonus question</a>, where <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@cks/116043764923637178\">I\nhave untested answers</a>.)</p>\n\n<h3>Sidebar: A related circular import puzzle and the answer</h3>\n\n<p>Let's take a slightly different version of my error message example\nabove, that simplifies things by leaving out c.py:</p>\n\n<blockquote><pre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">\n$ cat a.py\nfrom b import B; A = 10 + B\n$ cat b.py\nfrom a import A; B = 20 + A\n$ python a.py\n[...]\nImportError: cannot import name 'B' from 'b' [...]\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I first did this I was quite puzzled until the penny dropped.\nWhat's happening is that running '<code>python a.py</code>' isn't creating\nan 'a' module but instead a <code>__main__</code> module, so b.py doesn't\nfind a <code>sys.modules[\"a\"]</code> when it starts and instead creates one\nand starts loading it. That second version of a.py, now in an \"a\"\nmodule, is what tries to refer to b.B and finds it not there (yet).</p>\n</div>\n",

    "title": "Lockfiles Killed Vendoring",
    "link": "https://nesbitt.io/2026/02/10/lockfiles-killed-vendoring.html",
    "content": "<p>Whilst I was implementing a <a href=\"https://github.com/git-pkgs/git-pkgs/pull/98\">vendor command in git-pkgs</a>, I noticed that not many package manager clients have native vendoring commands. Go has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">go mod vendor</code>, Cargo has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cargo vendor</code>, and Bundler has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bundle cache</code>. That’s most of the first-class support I could find, which surprised me for something that used to be the dominant way to manage dependencies. So I went looking for what happened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vendoring-under-svn\">Vendoring under SVN</h3>\n\n<p>Before lockfiles and registries, if you wanted reproducible builds you checked your dependencies into source control. The alternative was hoping the internet served you the same bytes tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Under Subversion this worked fine. SVN checkouts only pull the current revision of the directories you ask for, leaving everything else on the server. You never download previous versions of vendored files, so a dependency updated twenty times costs you the same as one updated once. A 200MB vendor directory doesn’t slow you down if you never check it out, and CI can do the same. Most developers on a project never touched <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> directly, and the cost of carrying all that third-party code was invisible to everyone who wasn’t actively updating it.</p>\n\n<p>Rails formalized the convention with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> for third-party code and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lib/</code> for your own. You could even freeze the Rails framework itself into your vendor directory with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">rake rails:freeze:gems</code>. Chris Wanstrath’s “Vendor Everything” post on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/2007/http://errtheblog.com/posts/50-vendor-everything\">err the blog</a> in 2007 named the philosophy, though the practice traces back to 2006. Ryan McGeary updated it for the Bundler era in 2011 with <a href=\"http://ryan.mcgeary.org/2011/02/09/vendor-everything-still-applies/\">“Vendor Everything Still Applies”</a>: “Storage is cheap. You’ll thank me later when your deployments run smoothly.” Bundler’s arrival was effectively Rails admitting that physical vendoring was a dead end: pin versions in a lockfile instead. Composer made <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> its default install target. The name stuck because it was already familiar.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"git-clone\">git clone</h3>\n\n<p>Git clones the entire repository history by default. Every developer, every CI run, gets everything. A vendored dependency updated twenty times means twenty snapshots of its source tree in your .git directory, forever. Shallow clones and partial clones help, but as I wrote in <a href=\"/2025/12/24/package-managers-keep-using-git-as-a-database/\">package managers keep using git as a database</a>, they’re workarounds for a problem SVN never had.</p>\n\n<p>The weight became visible in ways it hadn’t been before: code search indexed everything in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code>. GitHub’s language statistics counted vendored code unless you added <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">linguist-vendored</code> to .gitattributes. Pull requests touching <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> generated walls of diff noise. The developer experience of working with a vendored codebase went from tolerable to actively painful.</p>\n\n<p>Security tooling piled on: GitHub’s dependency graph, Dependabot, and similar tools parse lockfiles and manifests to find vulnerable dependencies. Vendored code is invisible to them unless you go out of your way to make it discoverable. The entire vulnerability scanning ecosystem assumed lockfiles won and built around that assumption, which created a feedback loop: the more teams relied on automated scanning, the more vendoring looked like a liability rather than a safety net.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lockfiles-and-registries\">Lockfiles and registries</h3>\n\n<p>Bundler shipped Gemfile.lock in 2010, one of the first lockfiles to pin exact dependency versions with enough information to reproduce an install. But the ecosystem where vendoring arguments ran hottest didn’t have one for years. npm launched in 2010 too, and you’d specify <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">^1.2.0</code> in package.json and get whatever the registry served that day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2016/10/11/web/yarn-a-new-package-manager-for-javascript/\">Yarn launched</a> in October 2016 with yarn.lock and content hashes from day one. npm followed with <a href=\"https://blog.npmjs.org/post/161081169345/v500\">package-lock.json in npm 5.0</a> in May 2017. Once lockfiles recorded exact versions and integrity hashes (I covered the design choices in <a href=\"/2026/01/17/lockfile-format-design-and-tradeoffs/\">lockfile format design and tradeoffs</a>), you got reproducible builds without storing the code. The lockfile records what to fetch, the registry serves it, and the hash proves nothing changed in transit.</p>\n\n<p>Lockfiles spread to every major ecosystem. The <a href=\"/2025/11/15/package-manager-timeline\">package manager timeline</a> shows them arriving in waves: Bundler in 2010, Cargo.lock with Rust in 2015, Yarn and npm in 2016-2017, Poetry and uv bringing proper lockfiles to Python. Each one made vendoring less necessary for that community.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"left-pad\">left-pad</h3>\n\n<p>In March 2016, a developer <a href=\"https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm\">unpublished the 11-line left-pad package</a> from npm and broke builds across the ecosystem, including React and Babel. The immediate reaction was a rush back toward vendoring. If the registry can just delete packages, how can you trust it?</p>\n\n<p>The long-term response went the other way: npm <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish\">tightened its unpublish policy</a>. Lockfiles with content hashes meant even a re-uploaded package with different code would be caught. And enterprise proxy caches like <a href=\"https://jfrog.com/artifactory/\">Artifactory</a> filled the remaining availability gap: a local mirror that your builds pull from, still serving packages even when the upstream registry goes down or a maintainer rage-quits. The availability guarantee of vendoring, without anything in your git history.</p>\n\n<p>left-pad is sometimes framed as vindication for vendoring. I think it was the moment the industry decided to <a href=\"/2025/12/22/package-registries-are-governance-as-a-service/\">fix registry governance</a> rather than abandon registries altogether.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-c-shaped-hole\">The C-shaped hole</h3>\n\n<p>C never went through this transition because it never had the prerequisites: no dominant language package manager, no central registry that everyone publishes to, and no lockfile format. A lockfile is just a pointer to something in a registry, and if there’s no reliable registry to point to, you have to bring the code with you.</p>\n\n<p>As I wrote in <a href=\"/2026/01/27/the-c-shaped-hole-in-package-management/\">The C-Shaped Hole in Package Management</a>, developers are still dropping .c and .h files into source trees the way they have since the 1970s. Libraries like SQLite and stb are distributed as single files specifically to make this easy. Conan and vcpkg exist now, but neither has the cultural ubiquity that would make vendoring unnecessary. Without a registry everyone agrees on, vendoring in C remains the path of least resistance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"go-and-the-google-problem\">Go and the Google problem</h3>\n\n<p>Go was one of the last major languages to move past vendoring, and the reason traces straight back to Google. Go was designed at Google, by Google engineers, for Google’s development workflow. Google runs a monorepo and prizes hermetic builds: every build must be fully reproducible from what’s in the repository, with zero outside dependencies. Vendoring is how you get hermeticity, so all third-party code lives in the repository alongside first-party code, maintained by dedicated teams and managed by advanced tooling.</p>\n\n<p>So Go shipped without a real package manager. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">go get</code> fetched the latest commit from a repository with no versions, no lockfiles, and no registry. Russ Cox later acknowledged this in his <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/vgo\">Go += Package Versioning</a> series: “It was clear in the very first discussions of goinstall [in 2010] that we needed to do something about versioning. Unfortunately, it was not clear… exactly what to do.” They didn’t experience the pain internally because Google’s monorepo doesn’t need versions, since everything builds at head.</p>\n\n<p>The community filled the gap with godep, glide, and dep, and all of them used a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">vendor/</code> directory. <a href=\"https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25719-go15vendor.md\">Go 1.5 formalized vendoring support</a> in 2015, blessing what everyone was already doing. For five years, vendoring was the official answer.</p>\n\n<p>Go modules arrived in Go 1.11 in 2018 with go.mod and go.sum. But the piece that actually replaced vendoring came later: the module proxy at proxy.golang.org and the checksum database at sum.golang.org. Russ Cox argued in <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/vgo-module\">Defining Go Modules</a> that the proxy made vendor directories “almost entirely redundant.” The proxy caches modules indefinitely and the sum database verifies integrity, so together they provide monorepo-level guarantees to people who don’t have a monorepo: if the source disappears, the proxy still has it; if the code changes, the checksum catches it.</p>\n\n<p>As of this writing, Kubernetes still vendors its dependencies, a large project with the discipline to keep vendored code current, the same discipline Google has in its monorepo. Most teams don’t have that discipline, and for them, vendored dependencies go stale quietly until someone discovers a CVE six versions behind.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"nix-and-guix\">Nix and Guix</h3>\n\n<p>Nix and Guix take the idea in a different direction. They do something that looks a lot like vendoring but with different mechanics, and they go further than anyone else ever did. Nix doesn’t just vendor your libraries but the entire build closure: the library, the compiler that built it, the linker, the kernel headers. Every input gets copied into a content-addressed store, pinned by hash. A Nix <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">flake.lock</code> file pins exact input revisions and gets committed to the repository, while <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">nix build</code> fetches everything into <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/nix/store</code> where it lives alongside every other version of every other package, isolated and immutable.</p>\n\n<p>It’s hermeticity without the monorepo. You get offline builds, exact reproducibility, and a verifiable record of what went into your project. But the code lives in the Nix store rather than your repository, so you don’t pay the git history cost that made traditional vendoring painful. The tradeoff is complexity: you need to buy into Nix’s model of the world, and the learning curve is steep.</p>\n\n<p>If the vendoring instinct was always about control (knowing exactly what code you’re running, not depending on a registry being up and honest), then Nix is where that instinct ended up for the people who took it the most seriously.</p>",
