    "link": "https://seangoedecke.com/fast-llm-inference/",
    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/fast-mode\">Anthropic</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/\">OpenAI</a> both recently announced “fast mode”: a way to interact with their best coding model at significantly higher speeds.</p>\n<p>These two versions of fast mode are very different. Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/fast-mode#how-fast-mode-works\">offers</a> up to 2.5x tokens per second (so around 170, up from Opus 4.6’s 65). OpenAI’s offers more than 1000 tokens per second (up from GPT-5.3-Codex’s 65 tokens per second, so 15x). So OpenAI’s fast mode is six times faster than Anthropic’s<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>However, Anthropic’s big advantage is that they’re serving their actual model. When you use their fast mode, you get real Opus 4.6, while when you use OpenAI’s fast mode you get GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, not the real GPT-5.3-Codex. Spark is indeed much faster, but is a notably less capable model: good enough for many tasks, but it gets confused and messes up tool calls in ways that vanilla GPT-5.3-Codex would never do.</p>\n<p>Why the differences? The AI labs aren’t advertising the details of how their fast modes work, but I’m pretty confident it’s something like this: <strong>Anthropic’s fast mode is backed by <em>low-batch-size</em> inference, while OpenAI’s fast mode is backed by special monster Cerebras chips</strong>. Let me unpack that a bit.</p>\n<h3>How Anthropic’s fast mode works</h3>\n<p>The tradeoff at the heart of AI inference economics is <em>batching</em>, because the main bottleneck is <em>memory</em>. GPUs are very fast, but moving data onto a GPU is not. Every inference operation requires copying all the tokens of the user’s prompt<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> onto the GPU before inference can start. Batching multiple users up thus increases overall throughput at the cost of making users wait for the batch to be full.</p>\n<p>A good analogy is a bus system. If you had zero batching for passengers - if, whenever someone got on a bus, the bus departed immediately - commutes would be much faster <em>for the people who managed to get on a bus</em>. But obviously overall throughput would be much lower, because people would be waiting at the bus stop for hours until they managed to actually get on one.</p>\n<p>Anthropic’s fast mode offering is basically a bus pass that guarantees that the bus immediately leaves as soon as you get on. It’s six times the cost, because you’re effectively paying for all the other people who could have got on the bus with you, but it’s way faster<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> because you spend <em>zero</em> time waiting for the bus to leave.</p>\n<p>Obviously I can’t be fully certain this is right. Maybe they have access to some new ultra-fast compute that they’re running this on, or they’re doing some algorithmic trick nobody else has thought of. But I’m pretty sure this is it. Brand new compute or algorithmic tricks would likely require changes to the model (see below for OpenAI’s system), and “six times more expensive for 2.5x faster” is right in the ballpark for the kind of improvement you’d expect when switching to a low-batch-size regime.</p>\n<h3>How OpenAI’s fast mode works</h3>\n<p>OpenAI’s fast mode does not work anything like this. You can tell that simply because they’re introducing a new, worse model for it. There would be absolutely no reason to do that if they were simply tweaking batch sizes. Also, they told us in the announcement <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/\">blog post</a> exactly what’s backing their fast mode: Cerebras.</p>\n<p>OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/cerebras-partnership/\">announced</a> their Cerebras partnership a month ago in January. What’s Cerebras? They build “ultra low-latency compute”. What this means in practice is that they build <em>giant chips</em>. A H100 chip (fairly close to the frontier of inference chips) is just over a square inch in size. A Cerebras chip is <em>70</em> square inches.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a32e19a54795813e122dcbc1a5e013ef/d165a/cerebras.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"cerebras\"\n        title=\"cerebras\"\n        src=\"/static/a32e19a54795813e122dcbc1a5e013ef/1c72d/cerebras.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a32e19a54795813e122dcbc1a5e013ef/a80bd/cerebras.jpg 148w,\n/static/a32e19a54795813e122dcbc1a5e013ef/1c91a/cerebras.jpg 295w,\n/static/a32e19a54795813e122dcbc1a5e013ef/1c72d/cerebras.jpg 590w,\n/static/a32e19a54795813e122dcbc1a5e013ef/a8a14/cerebras.jpg 885w,\n/static/a32e19a54795813e122dcbc1a5e013ef/fbd2c/cerebras.jpg 1180w,\n/static/a32e19a54795813e122dcbc1a5e013ef/d165a/cerebras.jpg 1400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>You can see from pictures that the Cerebras chip has a grid-and-holes pattern all over it. That’s because silicon wafers this big are supposed to be broken into dozens of chips. Instead, Cerebras etches a giant chip over the entire thing.</p>\n<p>The larger the chip, the more internal memory it can have. The idea is to have a chip with SRAM large enough <em>to fit the entire model</em>, so inference can happen entirely in-memory. Typically GPU SRAM is measured in the tens of <em>megabytes</em>. That means that a lot of inference time is spent streaming portions of the model weights from outside of SRAM into the GPU compute<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>. If you could stream all of that from the (much faster) SRAM, inference would a big speedup: fifteen times faster, as it turns out!</p>\n<p>So how much internal memory does the latest Cerebras chip have? <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11698v1#:~:text=Most%20recently%2C%20the%20Wafer%20Scale,of%2021%20petabytes%20per%20second.\">44GB</a>. This puts OpenAI in kind of an awkward position. 44GB is enough to fit a small model (~20B params at fp16, ~40B params at int8 quantization), but clearly not enough to fit GPT-5.3-Codex. That’s why they’re offering a brand new model, and why the Spark model has a bit of “small model smell” to it: it’s a smaller <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation\">distil</a> of the much larger GPT-5.3-Codex model<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>.</p>\n<h3>OpenAI’s version is much more technically impressive</h3>\n<p>It’s interesting that the two major labs have two very different approaches to building fast AI inference. If I had to guess at a conspiracy theory, it would go something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenAI partner with Cerebras in mid-January, obviously to work on putting an OpenAI model on a fast Cerebras chip</li>\n<li>Anthropic have no similar play available, but they know OpenAI will announce some kind of blazing-fast inference in February, and they want to have something in the news cycle to compete with that</li>\n<li>Anthropic thus hustles to put together the kind of fast inference they <em>can</em> provide: simply lowering the batch size on their existing inference stack</li>\n<li>Anthropic (probably) waits until a few days before OpenAI are done with their much more complex Cerebras implementation to announce it, so it looks like OpenAI copied them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously OpenAI’s achievement here is more technically impressive. Getting a model running on Cerebras chips is not trivial, because they’re so weird. Training a 20B or 40B param distil of GPT-5.3-Codex that is still kind-of-good-enough is not trivial. But I commend Anthropic for finding a sneaky way to get ahead of the announcement that will be largely opaque to non-technical people. It reminds me of OpenAI’s mid-2025 sneaky introduction of the Responses API to help them <a href=\"/responses-api\">conceal their reasoning tokens</a>.</p>\n<h3>Is fast AI inference the next big thing?</h3>\n<p>Seeing the two major labs put out this feature might make you think that fast AI inference is the new major goal they’re chasing. I don’t think it is. If my theory above is right, Anthropic don’t care <em>that</em> much about fast inference, they just didn’t want to appear behind OpenAI. And OpenAI are mainly just exploring the capabilities of their new Cerebras partnership. It’s still largely an open question what kind of models can fit on these giant chips, how useful those models will be, and if the economics will make any sense.</p>\n<p>I personally don’t find “fast, less-capable inference” particularly useful. I’ve been playing around with it in Codex and I don’t like it. The usefulness of AI agents is dominated by <em>how few mistakes they make</em>, not by their raw speed. Buying 6x the speed at the cost of 20% more mistakes is a bad bargain, because most of the user’s time is spent handling mistakes instead of waiting for the model<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>However, it’s certainly possible that fast, less-capable inference becomes a core lower-level primitive in AI systems. Claude Code already uses <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1098#issuecomment-2884244872\">Haiku</a> for some operations. Maybe OpenAI will end up using Spark in a similar way.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>This isn’t even factoring in latency. Anthropic explicitly warns that time to first token might still be slow (or even slower), while OpenAI thinks the Spark latency is fast enough to warrant switching to a persistent websocket (i.e. they think the 50-200ms round trip time for the handshake is a significant chunk of time to first token).</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>Either in the form of the KV-cache for previous tokens, or as some big tensor of intermediate activations if inference is being pipelined through multiple GPUs. I write a lot more about this in <a href=\"/inference-batching-and-deepseek\"><em>Why DeepSeek is cheap at scale but expensive to run locally</em></a>, since it explains why DeepSeek can be offered at such cheap prices (massive batches allow an economy of scale on giant expensive GPUs, but individual consumers can’t access that at all).</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>Is it a contradiction that low-batch-size means low throughput, but this fast pass system gives users much greater throughput? No. The overall throughput of the <em>GPU</em> is much lower when some users are using “fast mode”, but those user’s throughput is much higher.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>Remember, GPUs are fast, but copying data onto them is not. Each “copy these weights to GPU” step is a meaningful part of the overall inference time.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5\">\n<p>Or a smaller distil of whatever more powerful base model GPT-5.3-Codex was itself distilled from. I don’t know how AI labs do it exactly, and they keep it very secret. More on that <a href=\"/ai-lab-structure\">here</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-6\">\n<p>On this note, it’s interesting to point out that Cursor’s hype dropped away basically at the same time they <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/composer\">released</a> their own “much faster, a little less-capable” agent model. Of course, much of this is due to Claude Code sucking up all the oxygen in the room, but having a very fast model certainly didn’t <em>help</em>.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

    "content": "<style>\n  pre {border:none;}\n</style>\nIn the 1980s, if you wanted your IBM PC to run faster, you could buy\nthe Intel 8087 floating-point coprocessor chip.\nWith this chip, CAD software, spreadsheets, flight simulators, and other programs\nwere much speedier.\nThe 8087 chip could add, subtract, multiply, and divide, of course, but it could\nalso compute\ntranscendental functions such as tangent and logarithms, as well as provide\nconstants such as &pi;.\nIn total, the 8087 added 62 new instructions to the computer.</p>\n<p>But how does a PC decide if an instruction was\na floating-point instruction for the 8087 or a regular instruction for the 8086 or 8088 CPU?\nAnd how does the 8087 chip interpret instructions to determine what they mean?\nIt turns out that decoding an instruction inside the 8087 is more complicated than you might expect.\nThe 8087 uses multiple techniques, with decoding circuitry spread across the chip.\nIn this blog post, I'll explain how these decoding circuits work.</p>\n<p>To reverse-engineer the 8087, I chiseled open the ceramic package of an 8087 chip and took numerous photos of the silicon die with a microscope.\nThe complex patterns on the die are formed by its metal wiring, as well as the polysilicon and silicon underneath.\nThe bottom half of the chip is the \"datapath\", the circuitry that performs calculations on 80-bit floating point values. \nAt the left of the datapath, a <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2020/05/extracting-rom-constants-from-8087-math.html\">constant ROM</a> holds important constants such as &pi;.\nAt the right are the eight registers that the\nprogrammer uses to hold floating-point values; in an unusual design decision,\nthese registers are arranged as a <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2025/12/8087-stack-circuitry.html\">stack</a>.\nFloating-point numbers cover a huge range by representing numbers with a fractional part and an exponent;\nthe 8087 has separate circuitry to process the fractional part and the exponent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/8087-die-labeled.jpg\"><img alt=\"Die of the Intel 8087 floating point unit chip, with main functional blocks labeled.

The die is 5 mm&times;6 mm. Click this image (or any others) for a larger image.</div></p>\n<p>The chip's instructions are defined by the large <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2018/09/two-bits-per-transistor-high-density.html\">microcode ROM</a> in the middle.<span id=\"fnref:microcode\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:microcode\">1</a></span>\nTo execute an instruction, the 8087 decodes the instruction and the microcode engine starts executing\nthe appropriate micro-instructions from the microcode ROM.\nIn the upper right part of the chip, the Bus Interface Unit (BIU) communicates with the\nmain processor and memory over the computer's bus. \nFor the most part, the BIU and the rest of the chip operate independently,\nbut as we will see, the BIU plays important roles in instruction decoding and execution.</p>\n<h2>Cooperation with the main 8086/8088 processor</h2>\n<p>The 8087 chip acted as a coprocessor with the main 8086 (or 8088) processor. When a floating-point instruction was encountered,\nthe 8086 would let the 8087 floating-point chip carry out the floating-point instruction.\nBut how do the 8086 and the 8087 determine which chip executes a particular instruction?\nYou might expect the 8086 to tell the 8087 when it should execute an instruction, but\nthis cooperation turns out to be more\ncomplicated.</p>\n<p>The 8086 has eight opcodes that are assigned to the coprocessor, called <code>ESCAPE</code> opcodes.\nThe 8087 determines what instruction the 8086 is executing by watching the bus,\na task performed by the BIU (Bus Interface Unit).<span id=\"fnref:queue\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:queue\">2</a></span>\nIf the instruction is an <code>ESCAPE</code>, the instruction is intended for the 8087.\nHowever, there's a problem. The 8087 doesn't have any access to the 8086's registers (and vice versa), so the only way\nthat they can exchange data is through memory.\nBut the 8086 addresses memory through a complicated scheme involving offsest registers and segment registers.\nHow can the 8087 determine what memory address to use when it doesn't have access to the registers?</p>\n<p>The trick is that when an <code>ESCAPE</code> instruction is encountered,\nthe 8086 processor starts executing the instruction, even though it is intended for the 8087.\nThe 8086 computes the memory address that the instruction references and\nreads that memory address, but ignores the result.\nMeanwhile, the 8087 watches the memory bus to see what address is accessed and stores this address internally in a BIU register.\nWhen the 8087 starts executing the instruction, it uses the address from the 8086 to read and write\nmemory.\nIn effect, the 8087 offloads address computation to the 8086 processor.</p>\n<h2>The structure of 8087 instructions</h2>\n<p>To understand the 8087's instructions, we need to take a closer look at the structure of 8086\ninstructions. In particular, something called the ModR/M byte is important since all 8087 instructions\nuse it.</p>\n<p>The 8086 uses a complex system of opcodes with a mixture of single-byte opcodes, prefix bytes, and longer instructions.\nAbout a quarter of the opcodes use a second byte, called ModR/M,\nthat specifies the registers and/or memory address\nto use through a complicated encoding.\nFor instance, the memory address can be computed by adding the BX and SI registers, or from the BP register plus a two-byte offset.\nThe first two bits of the ModR/M byte are the \"MOD\" bits. For a memory access, the MOD bits indicate\nhow many address displacement bytes follow the ModR/M byte (0, 1, or 2), while\nthe \"R/M\" bits specify how the address is computed.\nA MOD value of 3, however, indicates that the instruction operates on registers and does\nnot access memory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/modrm.jpg\"><img alt=\"Structure of an 8087 instruction\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"122\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/modrm-w600.jpg\" title=\"Structure of an 8087 instruction\" width=\"600\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">Structure of an 8087 instruction</div></p>\n<p>The diagram above shows how an 8087 instruction consists of an <code>ESCAPE</code> opcode, followed by\na ModR/M byte.\nAn <code>ESCAPE</code> opcode is indicated by the special bit pattern <code>11011</code>, leaving three bits (green) available\nin the first byte to specify the type of 8087 instruction.\nAs mentioned above, the ModR/M byte has two forms.\nThe first form performs a memory access; it has MOD bits of <code>00</code>,<code>01</code>, or <code>10</code> and the R/M bits\nspecify how the memory address is computed. This leaves three bits (green) to specify the address.\nThe second form operates internally, without a memory access; it has MOD bits of <code>11</code>.\nSince the R/M bits aren't used in the second form, six bits (green) are available in the R/M byte\nto specify the instruction.</p>\n<p>The challenge for the designers of the 8087 was to fit all the instructions into the available bits\nin such a way that decoding is straightforward.\nThe diagram below shows a few 8087 instructions, illustrating how they achieve this.\nThe first three instructions operate internally, so they have MOD bits of 11; the green\nbits specify the particular instruction.\nAddition is more complicated because it can act on memory (first format) or registers (second format), depending on the <code>MOD</code> bits.\nThe four bits highlighted in bright green (<code>0000</code>) are the same for all <code>ADD</code> instructions;\nthe subtract, multiplication, and division instructions use the same structure but have\ndifferent values for\nthe dark green bits. For instance, <code>0001</code> indicates multiplication and <code>0100</code> indicates subtraction.\nThe other green bits (<code>MF</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>P</code>) select variants of the addition instruction,\nchanging the data format, direction, and popping the stack at the end.\nThe last three bits select the R/M addressing mode for a memory operation, or the stack register\n<code>ST(i)</code> for a register operation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/opcodes.jpg\"><img alt=\"The bit patterns for some 8087 instructions.

(If no transistors are turned on, the pull-up transistor\npulls the output high.)\nThus, the pattern of doped silicon regions creates a grid of transistors in the PLA that\nimplements the desired logic function.<span id=\"fnref:nor\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:nor\">7</a></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/pla-diagram.jpg\"><img alt=\"Part of the PLA for instruction decoding.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"231\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/pla-diagram-w300.jpg\" title=\"Part of the PLA for instruction decoding.\" width=\"300\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">Part of the PLA for instruction decoding.</div></p>\n<p>The standard way to decode instructions with a PLA is to take the instruction bits (and their complements) as inputs.\nThe PLA can then pattern-match against bit patterns in the instruction.\nHowever, the 8087 also uses some pre-processing to reduce the size of the PLA.\nFor instance, the <code>MOD</code> bits are processed to generate a signal if the bits are 0, 1, or 2 (i.e.\na memory operation) and a second signal if the bits are 3 (i.e. a register operation).\nThis allows the 0, 1, and 2 cases to be handled by a single PLA pattern.\nAnother signal indicates that the top bits are <code>001 111xxxxx</code>; this indicates that the R/M field\ntakes part in instruction selection.<span id=\"fnref:table\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:table\">8</a></span>\nSometimes a PLA output is fed back in as an input, so a decoded group of instructions can be\nexcluded from another group.\nThese techniques all reduce the size of the PLA at the cost of some additional logic gates.</p>\n<p>The result of the instruction decoding PLA's AND plane is 22 signals, where each signal\ncorresponds to an\ninstruction or group of instructions with a shared microcode entry point.\nThe lower part of the instruction decoding PLA acts as a ROM that holds the 22 microcode entry points\nand provides the selected one.<span id=\"fnref:entry-points\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:entry-points\">9</a></span></p>\n<h2>Instruction decoding inside the microcode</h2>\n<p>Many 8087 instructions share the same microcode routines. For instance, \nthe addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, reverse subtraction, and reverse division instructions all go to the same microcode routine.\nThis reduces the size of the microcode since these instructions share the microcode that sets up the instruction and handles the\nresult.\nHowever, the microcode obviously needs to diverge at some point to perform the specific operation.\nMoreover, some arithmetic opcodes access the top of the stack, some access an arbitrary location in the stack, some access memory, and some reverse the operands, requiring\ndifferent microcode actions.\nHow does the microcode do different things for different opcodes while sharing code?</p>\n<p>The trick is that the 8087's microcode engine supports conditional subroutine calls, returns, and jumps, based on 49 different\nconditions (<a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2025/12/8087-microcode-conditions.html\">details</a>).\nIn particular, fifteen conditions examine the instruction.\nSome conditions test specific bit patterns, such as branching if the lowest bit is set, or more complex patterns such as\nan opcode matching <code>0xx 11xxxxxx</code>. Other conditions detect specific instructions such as <code>FMUL</code>.\nThe result is that the microcode can take different paths for different instructions. For instance, a reverse subtraction or\nreverse division is implemented in the microcode by testing the instruction and reversing the arguments if necessary, while sharing the rest of the code.</p>\n<p>The microcode also has a special jump target that performs a three-way jump depending on the\ncurrent machine instruction that is being executed.\nThe microcode engine has a jump ROM that holds 22 entry points for jumps or subroutine calls.<span id=\"fnref:jump\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:jump\">10</a></span>\nHowever, a jump to target 0 uses special circuitry so it will instead jump to\ntarget 1\nfor a multiplication instruction,\ntarget 2 for an addition/subtraction, or\ntarget 3 for division.\nThis special jump is implemented by gates in the upper right corner of the jump decoder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/jump-rom.jpg\"><img alt=\"The jump decoder and ROM.

This causes the 8087 to start interpreting the instruction and stores\nthe opcode in a BIU register for use\nby the instruction decoder.\nA second small PLA takes the outputs from the top-5 PLA and combines them with the lower three bits.\nIt decodes specific instruction values:\n<code>D9</code>, <code>DB</code>, <code>DD</code>, <code>E0</code>, <code>E1</code>, <code>E2</code>, or <code>E3</code>.\nThe first three values correspond to specific ESCAPE instructions,\nand are recorded in latches.</p>\n<p>The two PLAs decode the second byte in the same way.\nLogic gates combine the PLA outputs from the second byte with the latched values from the first byte,\ndetecting eleven hardwired instructions.<span id=\"fnref:control\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:control\">11</a></span>\nSome of these instructions operate directly on registers, such as clearing exceptions;\nthe decoded instruction signal \ngoes to the relevant register and modifies it in an ad hoc way. <span id=\"fnref:fclex\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:fclex\">12</a></span>.\nOther hardwired instructions are more complicated, writing chip state to memory or reading chip state from memory.\nThese instructions require multiple memory operations, controlled by the Bus Interface Unit's state machine.\nEach of these instructions has a flip-flop that is triggered by the decoded instruction to keep track of which instruction is active.</p>\n<p>For the instructions that save and restore the 8087's state (<code>FSAVE</code> and <code>FRSTOR</code>), there's one more complication.\nThese instructions are partially implemented in the BIU, which moves the relevant BIU registers to or from memory.\nBut then, instruction processing switches to microcode, where a microcode routine saves\nor loads the floating-point registers. \nJumping to the microcode routine is not implemented through the regular microcode jump circuitry.\nInstead, two hardcoded values force the microcode address to the save or restore routine.<span id=\"fnref:save\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:save\">13</a></span></p>\n<h2>Constants</h2>\n<p>The 8087 has seven instructions to load floating-point constants such as &pi;, 1, or log<sub>10</sub>(2). \nThe 8087 has a constant ROM that holds these constants, as well as constants for transcendental\noperations.\nYou might expect that the 8087 simply loads the specified constant from the constant ROM, using\nthe instruction to select the desired constant.\nHowever, the process is much more complicated.<span id=\"fnref:constants\"><a class=\"ref\" href=\"#fn:constants\">14</a></span></p>\n<p>Looking at the instruction decode ROM shows that different constants are implemented with different\nmicrocode routines: the constant-loading instructions <code>FLDLG2</code> and <code>FLDLN2</code> have one entry\npoint; <code>FLD1</code>, <code>FLD2E</code>, <code>FLDL2T</code>, and <code>FLDPI</code> have a second entry point, and <code>FLDZ</code> (zero) has a third entry point.\nIt's understandable that zero is a special case, but why are there two routines for the other constants?</p>\n<p>The explanation is that the fraction part of each constant is stored in the constant ROM, but the\nexponent is stored in a separate, smaller ROM.\nTo reduce the size of the exponent ROM, only some of the necessary exponents are stored.\nIf a constant needs an exponent one larger than a value in the ROM, the microcode adds one to the\nexponent ROM value, computing the exponent on the fly.</p>\n<p>Thus, the load-constant instructions use three separate instruction decoding mechanisms.\nFirst, the instruction decode ROM determines the appropriate microcode routine for the constant\ninstruction, as before.\nThen, the constant PLA decodes the instruction to select the appropriate constant.\nFinally, the microcode routine tests the bottom bit of the instruction and increments the\nexponent if necessary.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>To wrap up the discussion of the decoding circuitry, the diagram below shows how the\ndifferent circuits are arranged on the die. This image shows the upper-right part of the die;\nthe microcode engine is at the left and part of the ROM is at the bottom.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/decoding-labeled.jpg\"><img alt=\"The upper-left portion of the 8087 die, with functional blocks labeled.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"447\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/decoding-labeled-w600.jpg\" title=\"The upper-left portion of the 8087 die, with functional blocks labeled.\" width=\"600\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">The upper-left portion of the 8087 die, with functional blocks labeled.</div></p>\n<p>The 8087 doesn't have a clean architecture, but instead is full of ad hoc circuits and corner\ncases.\nThe 8087's instruction decoding is an example of this.\nDecoding is complicated to start with due to the 8086's convoluted instruction\nformats and the ModR/M byte.\nOn top of that, the 8087's instruction decoding has multiple layers: the instruction decode PLA,\nmicrocode conditional jumps that depend on the instruction, a special jump target that\ndepends on the instruction,\nconstants selected based on the instruction, and instructions decoded by the BIU.</p>\n<p>The 8087 has a reason for this complicated architecture: at the time, the chip was on the\nedge of what was possible, so the designers needed to use whatever techniques they could to\nreduce the size of the chip. If implementing a corner case could shave a few transistors off the\nchip or make the microcode ROM slightly smaller, the corner case was worthwhile.\nEven so, the 8087 was barely manufacturable at first; early yield was just two working chips\nper silicon wafer.\nDespite this difficult start, a floating-point standard based on the 8087 is now part of almost every processor.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the members of the \"Opcode Collective\" for their contributions, especially Smartest Blob and Gloriouscow.</p>\n<p>For updates, follow me on\n Bluesky (<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/righto.com\">@righto.com</a>),\nMastodon (<a href=\"https://oldbytes.space/@kenshirriff\">@kenshirriff@oldbytes.space</a>),\nor <a href=\"http://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<h2>Notes and references</h2>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:microcode\">\n<p>The contents of the microcode ROM are available <a href=\"https://github.com/a-mcego/granite/blob/main/tools/8087mc/bin/8087mc_out.txt\">here</a>, partially decoded thanks to Smartest Blob.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:microcode\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:queue\">\n<p>It is difficult for the 8087 to determine what the 8086 is doing because the 8086 prefetches\ninstructions. Thus, when an instruction is seen on the bus, the 8086 may execute it at some\npoint in the future, or it may end up discarded.</p>\n<p>In order to tell what instruction is being executed, the 8087 floating-point chip internally duplicates the 8086 processor's queue.\nThe 8087 watches the memory bus and copies any instructions that are prefetched.\nSince the 8087 can't tell from the bus when the 8086 starts a new instruction or when the 8086 empties the queue when jumping to a new address,\nthe 8086 processor provides two queue status signals to the 8087.\nWith the help of these signals, the 8087 knows exactly what the 8086 is executing.</p>\n<p>The 8087's instruction queue has six 8-bit registers, the same as the 8086.\nSurprisingly, the last two queue registers in the 8087 are tied together, so there are\nonly five usable queue registers.\nMy hypothesis is that since the 8087 copies the active instruction into separate registers\n(unlike the 8086), only five queue registers are needed. This raises the question of\nwhy the excess register wasn't removed from the die, rather than wasting valuable space.</p>\n<p>The 8088 processor, used in the IBM PC, has a four-byte queue instead of a six-byte queue. The 8088 is almost identical to the 8086\nexcept it has an 8-bit memory bus instead of a 16-bit memory bus. With the narrower memory bus, prefetching is more likely to get in\nthe way of other memory accesses, so a smaller prefetch queue was implemented.</p>\n<p>Knowing the queue size is essential to the 8087 floating-point chip.\nTo indicate this, when the processor boots, a signal lets the 8087 determine if the attached processor is\nan 8086 or an 8088.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:queue\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:opcode\">\n<p>The relevant part of the opcode is 11 bits:\nthe top 5 bits are always\n<code>11011</code> for an <code>ESCAPE</code> opcode, so they can be ignored during decoding.\nThe Bus Interface Unit has a 3-bit register to hold the\nfirst byte of the instruction and an 8-bit register to hold the second byte.\nThe BIU registers have an irregular appearance because there are 3-bit registers, 8-bit\nregisters, and 10-bit registers (holding half of a 20-bit address).&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:opcode\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:rom\">\n<p>What's the difference between a PLA and a ROM?\nThere is a lot of overlap: a ROM can replace a PLA, while a PLA can implement a ROM.\nA ROM is essentially a PLA where the first stage is a binary decoder, so the ROM\nhas a separate row for each input value.\nHowever, the first stage of a ROM can be optimized so multiple inputs share the same output value;\nis this a ROM or a PLA?</p>\n<p>The \"official\" difference is that in a ROM, one row is activated at a time, while in a PLA,\nmultiple rows can be activated at once, so the output values are combined.\n(Thus, it is straightforward to read the values out of a ROM, but more difficult to read\nthe values out of a PLA.)</p>\n<p>I consider the instruction decoding PLA to be best described as a PLA first stage with the\nsecond stage acting as a ROM.\nYou could also call it a partially-decoded ROM, or just a PLA.\nHopefully my terminology isn't too confusing.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:rom\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 4 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:matching\">\n<p>To match a bit pattern in an instruction, \nthe bits of the instruction are fed into the PLA, along with the complements of these bits; this allows the PLA to match against a 0\nbit or a 1 bit.\nEach row of a PLA will match a particular bit pattern in the instruction: bits that must be 1, bits that must be 0, and bits that don't matter.\nIf the instruction opcodes are assigned rationally, a small number of bit patterns will match all the opcodes, reducing the size of the\ndecoder.</p>\n<p>I may be going too far with this analogy, but a PLA is a lot like a neural net. Each column in the AND plane is like a\nneuron that fires when it recognizes a particular input pattern.\nThe OR plane is like a second layer in a neural net, combining signals from the first layer.\nThe PLA's \"weights\", however, are fixed at 0 or 1, so it's not as flexible as a \"real\" neural net.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:matching\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 5 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:pla-layout\">\n<p>The instruction decoding PLA has an unusual layout, where the second plane is rotated 90&deg;.\nIn a regular PLA (left), the inputs (red) go into the first plane, the perpendicular outputs from the first plane (purple) go into the second plane,\nand the PLA outputs (blue) exit parallel to the inputs.\nIn the address PLA, however, the second plane is rotated 90&deg;, so the outputs are perpendicular to the inputs.\nThis approach requires additional wiring (horizontal purple lines), but presumably, this layout worked better in the 8087 since the outputs are lined up with the rest of the microcode engine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/folded.jpg\"><img alt=\"Conceptual diagram of a regular PLA on the left and a rotated PLA on the right.\" class=\"hilite\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/folded-w350.jpg\" title=\"Conceptual diagram of a regular PLA on the left and a rotated PLA on the right.\" width=\"350\" /></a><div class=\"cite\">Conceptual diagram of a regular PLA on the left and a rotated PLA on the right.</div></p>\n<p><!-- -->&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:pla-layout\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 6 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:nor\">\n<p>To describe the implementation of a PLA in more detail, the transistors in each row of the AND plane form a NOR gate, since if any transistor is turned on, it pulls the output low.\n Likewise, the transistors in each column of the OR plane form a NOR gate.\n So why is the PLA described as having an AND plane and an OR plane, rather than two NOR planes?\n By using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws\">De Morgan's law</a>, you can treat the NOR-NOR Boolean equations as\n equivalent to AND-OR Boolean equations (with the inputs and outputs inverted).\n It's usually much easier to understand the logic as AND terms OR'd together.</p>\n<p>The converse question is why don't they build the PLA from AND and OR gates instead of NOR gates? The reason is that AND and OR\n gates are harder to build with NMOS transistors, since you need to add explicit inverter circuits.\n Moreover, NMOS NOR gates are typically faster than NAND gates because the transistors are in parallel. (CMOS is the opposite;\n NAND gates are faster because the weaker PMOS transistors are in parallel.)&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:nor\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 7 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:table\">\n<p><style type=\"text/css\">\ntable#op8087 {border-collapse: collapse; font-family: sans-serif;}\ntable#op8087 td {border: 1px solid white;}\n</style></p>\n<p>The 8087's opcodes can be organized into tables, showing the underlying structure.\n(In each table, the row (Y) coordinate is the bottom 3 bits of the first byte and the column (X) coordinate\nis the 3 bits after the MOD bits in the second byte.)</p>\n<p>Memory operations use the following encoding with MOD = 0, 1, or 2.\nEach box represents 8 different addressing modes.</p>\n<p><table id=\"op8087\">\n<tr><th>&nbsp;</th>\n<th>0</th>\n<th>1</th>\n<th>2</th>\n<th>3</th>\n<th>4</th>\n<th>5</th>\n<th>6</th>\n<th>7</th>\n</tr>\n<tr><th>0</th>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFD6A5\">FADD</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FDFFB6\">FMUL</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#CAFFBF\">FCOM</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#CAFFBF\">FCOMP</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#9BF6FF\">FSUB</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#9BF6FF\">FSUBR</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#A0C4FF\">FDIV</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#A0C4FF\">FDIVR</td>\n<tr><th>1</th>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#BDB2FF\">FLD</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FST</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FSTP</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:yellow\">FLDENV</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:yellow\">FLDCW</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:yellow\">FSTENV</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:yellow\">FSTCW</td>\n<tr><th>2</th>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFD6A5\">FIADD</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FDFFB6\">FIMUL</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#CAFFBF\">FICOM</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#CAFFBF\">FICOMP</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#9BF6FF\">FISUB</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#9BF6FF\">FISUBR</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#A0C4FF\">FIDIV</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#A0C4FF\">FIDIVR</td>\n<tr><th>3</th>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#BDB2FF\">FILD</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FIST</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FISTP</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#BDB2FF\">FLD</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FSTP</td>\n<tr><th>4</th>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFD6A5\">FADD</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FDFFB6\">FMUL</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#CAFFBF\">FCOM</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#CAFFBF\">FCOMP</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#9BF6FF\">FSUB</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#9BF6FF\">FSUBR</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#A0C4FF\">FDIV</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#A0C4FF\">FDIVR</td>\n<tr><th>5</th>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#BDB2FF\">FLD</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FST</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FSTP</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:yellow\">FRSTOR</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:yellow\">FSAVE</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:yellow\">FSTSW</td>\n<tr><th>6</th>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFD6A5\">FIADD</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FDFFB6\">FIMUL</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#CAFFBF\">FICOM</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#CAFFBF\">FICOMP</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#9BF6FF\">FISUB</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#9BF6FF\">FISUBR</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#A0C4FF\">FIDIV</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#A0C4FF\">FIDIVR</td>\n<tr><th>7</th>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#BDB2FF\">FILD</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FIST</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FISTP</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#BDB2FF\">FBLD</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#BDB2FF\">FILD</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FBSTP</td>\n<td  style=\"background-color:#FFC6FF\">FISTP</td>\n</tr>\n</table></p>\n<p>The important point is that the instruction encoding has a lot of regularity, making the decoding\nprocess easier.

Along the way, it goes through a flip-flop to synchronize the timing,\na gate to combine it with the reset signal, and various inverters and drivers.\nEven though these instructions seem like they should complete immediately, they typically take 5 clock cycles due to overhead in the 8087.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:fclex\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 12 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:save\">\n<p>I'll give more details here on the circuit that jumps to the save or restore microcode.\nThe BIU sends two signals to the microcode engine, one to jump to the save code and one to\njump to the restore code.\nThese signals are buffered and delayed by a capacitor, probably to adjust the timing of the\nsignal.</p>\n<p>In the microcode engine, there are two hardcoded constants for the routines, just above\nthe jump table; the\nBIU signal causes the appropriate constant to go onto the micro-address lines.\nEach bit in the address has a pull-up transistor to +5V or a pull-down transistor to ground.\nThis approach is somewhat inefficient since it requires two transistor sites per bit. In\ncomparison, the jump address ROM and the instruction address ROM use one transistor site\nper bit.\n(As in a PLA, each transistor is present or absent as needed, so the number of physical\ntransistors is less than the number of transistor sites.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.righto.com/images/8087-decode/capacitors.jpg\"><img alt=\"Two capacitors in the 8087.

The <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/14/square-root-minus-1-mod-p/\">previous post</a> showed how that&#8217;s done.</p>\n<p>In this post we will complete Wagon&#8217;s algorithm by writing the modified version of the euclidean algorithm.</p>\n<p>Suppose <em>p</em> is an odd prime, and we&#8217;ve found <em>x</em> such that <em>x</em>² = −1 mod <em>p</em> as in the previous posts. The last step in Wagon&#8217;s algorithm is to apply the Euclidean algorithm to <em>x</em> and <em>p</em> and stop when the numbers are both less than √<em>p</em>.</p>\n<p>When we&#8217;re working with large integers, how do we find square roots? Maybe <em>p</em> and even √<em>p</em> are too big to represent as a floating point number, so we can&#8217;t just apply the <code>sqrt</code> function. Maybe <em>p</em> is less than the largest floating point number (around 10<sup>308</sup>) but the <code>sqrt</code> function doesn&#8217;t have enough precision. Floats only have 53 bits of precision, so an integer larger than 2<sup>53</sup> cannot necessarily be represented entirely accurately.</p>\n<p>The solution is to use the <code>isqrt</code> function, introduced in Python 3.8. It returns the largest integer less than the square root of its argument.</p>\n<p>Now we have everything necessary to finish implementing Wagon&#8217;s algorithm.</p>\n<pre>from sympy import legendre_symbol, nextprime\nfrom math import isqrt\n\ndef find_nonresidue(p):\n    q = 2\n    while legendre_symbol(q, p) == 1:\n        q = nextprime(q)\n    return q\n\ndef my_euclidean_algorithm(a, b, stop):\n    while a &gt; stop:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return (a, b)\n\ndef find_ab(p):\n    assert(p % 4 == 1)\n    k = p // 4\n    c = find_nonresidue(p)\n    x = pow(c, k, p)\n    return my_euclidean_algorithm(p, x, isqrt(p))\n</pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use this to find <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> such that <em>x</em>² + <em>y</em>² = <em>p</em> where <em>p</em> = 2<sup>255</sup> − 19.</p>\n<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b = find_ab(p := 2**255 - 19)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n230614434303103947632580767254119327050\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b\n68651491678749784955913861047835464643\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a**2 + b**2 - p\n0\n</pre>\n<p><span lang=\"fr\">Finis</span>.</p>The post <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/14/wagons-algorithm-in-python/\">Wagon’s algorithm in Python</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog\">John D.

Beautiful paragraphs!</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Gutenberg_bible_Old_Testament_Epistle_of_St_Jerome.jpg\" width=\"2009\" height=\"2877\">\n</figure>\n<p>We are not quite there yet, hence the present bug report.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A naive way to break text into lines to form a paragraph of a given width is greediness: add the\nnext word to the current line if it fits, otherwise start a new line. The result is unlikely to be\npretty — sometimes it makes sense to try to squeeze one more word on a line to make the lines more\nbalanced overall. Johannes Gutenberg did this sort of thing manually, to produce a beautiful page\nabove. In 1981, Knuth and Plass figured out a way to teach computer to do this, using dynamic\nprogramming, for line breaking in TeX.</p>\n<p>Inexplicably, until 2025, browsers stuck with the naive greedy algorithm, subjecting generations of\nweb users to ugly typography. To be fair, the problem in a browser is harder version than the one\nsolved by Gutenberg, Plass, and Knuth. In print, the size of the page is fixed, so you can compute\noptimal line breaking once, offline. In the web context, the window width is arbitrary and even\nchanges dynamically, so the line-breaking has to be “online”. On the other hand, XXI century\nbrowsers have a bit more compute resources than we had in 1980 or even 1450!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Making lines approximately equal in terms of number of characters is only half-way through towards a\nbeautiful paragraph. No matter how you try, the length won’t be exactly the same, so, if you want\nboth the left and the right edges of the page to be aligned, you also need to fudge the spaces\nbetween the words a bit. In CSS,\n<span class=\"display\"><code>text-wrap: pretty</code></span>\nasks the browser to select line breaks in an intelligent way to make lines roughly equal, and\n<span class=\"display\"><code>text-align: justify</code></span>\nadjusts whitespace to make them equal exactly.</p>\n<p>Although Safari is the first browser to ship a non-joke implementation of <code>text-wrap</code>, the\ncombination with <code>text-align</code> looks ugly, as you can see in this very blog post. To pin the ugliness\ndown, the whitespace between the words is blown out of proportion. Here’s the same justified\nparagraph with and without <code>text-wrap: pretty</code>:</p>\n<figure class=\"two-col\">\n    <img alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"202\" style=\"max-width: 40%; border: 1px solid black;\"\n        src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf77eec-9e33-4900-b761-23a604892b2f\">\n    <img alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"202\" style=\"max-width: 40%; border: 1px solid black;\"\n        src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75a7e7a8-0d34-448a-877c-4368567fe598\">\n</figure>\n<p>The paragraph happens to look ok with greedy line-breaking. But the “smart” algorithm decides to add\nan entire line to it, which requires inflating all the white space proportionally. By itself, either\nof</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-selector-tag\">p</span> {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    text-wrap: pretty;</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"hl-attribute\">text-align</span>: justify;</span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>looks alright. It’s just the combination of the two that is broken.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This behavior is a natural consequence of implementation. My understanding is that the dynamic\nprogramming scoring function aims to get each line close to the target width, and is penalized for\ndeviations. Crucially, the actual max width of a paragraph is fixed: while a line can be arbitrary\nshorter, it can’t be any longer, otherwise it’ll overflow. For this reason, the dynamic programming\nsets the target width to be a touch narrower than the paragraph. That way, it’s possible to both\nunder and overshoot, leading to better balance overall. As per\n<a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/16547/better-typography-with-text-wrap-pretty/#:~:text=And%20here’s%20how%20the%20same%20text%20looks\">original article</a>:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"blockquote\">\n<blockquote><p>The browser aims to wrap each line sooner than the maximum limit of the text box. It wraps\nwithin the range, definitely after the magenta line, and definitely before the red line.</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/demo-2-light.png\" width=\"1728\" height=\"1099\">\n</figure>\n</blockquote>\n\n</figure>\n<p>But if you subsequently justify all the way to the red line, the systematic overshoot will manifest\nitself as too wide inter-word space!</p>\n<p>WebKit devs, you are awesome for shipping this feature ahead of everyone else, please fix this small\nwrinkle such that I can make my blog look the way I had intended all along ;-)</p>\n",

suddenly-in-demand fiber optic cable for AI data centers. &#8220;In 2018, Weeks and O&#8217;Day went to Dallas to tour a data center owned by Meta, then known as Facebook. They marveled at the demand for fiber-optic cabling to connect all the servers inside that giant warehouse. Facebook was using a mix of copper cables and existing fiber optics, but found both ill-suited to the task. This spurred Corning&#8217;s engineers to make their cables thinner, but also tougher, so they could withstand tight bends, says Claudio Mazzali, Corning&#8217;s head of research. Five years later, ChatGPT made its debut, and demand for fiber-powered data centers exploded. &#8220;We&#8217;re thankful that we made the trip in 2018 and thankful that we made the bet,&#8221; says O&#8217;Day. At the time, they had no idea whether it would be a good investment or a dud, he adds.&#8221; [<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/corning-fiber-optics-ai-e045ba3b\">Wall Street Journal</a>]</p><p>In other glass manufacturing news, the WSJ also has a piece about windshield manufacturers upset about a US-based, Chinese-owned windshield factory making windshields for far cheaper than they can.

But there’s no reason it can’t be text-driven.</h2><img src=\"https://static.tedium.co/uploads/tedium021426.gif\" alt=\"Design Deconstruction\"><div class=\"whitebox\"><p><strong>To me, the hard part about being creative</strong> is that you’re always trying to look for a new path.</p><p>Sure, you’ve done things a certain way for a long time, and it’s worked for you. But it’s hard not to want to dabble in new directions just to see where it takes you, and hope that it shakes out a new idea or two.</p><p>Which is perhaps the reason I’ve started to fixate on a weird idea—that design tools might sometimes work better without an attached graphical interface. Rather than graphics in, graphics out, maybe sometimes it should be text in, graphics out.</p><p>The myth about design is that it’s a function of the creativity-driven right side of the brain. But I think that’s only half the story. See, with design, there’s a lot of hidden math involved. Ask your favorite newspaper or magazine designer about pica rulers and column lengths, and you’ll get what I’m saying.</p><p>Put another way: Designers need to be creative problem solvers, painting the perfect canvas, but they also need to be pragmatic, considering the realities of “yes, it’s long, but we have to fit this text.”</p><p>Tools like InDesign and Final Cut Pro have traditionally combined the canvas and the broader frameworks that make a good design, mixing tools with differing cognitive loads into one interface. But what if design needs to be a bit more deconstructed, where pieces are more separated out, perhaps not even graphical? What if you designed with code? Would that lead to better results? I wanted to find out.</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/azLEvhKZC7T40g6Tnxr3GHQuxas=/1000x762/filters:quality(80)/uploads/cropped_termux.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"762\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"cropped_termux.jpg\" /><figcaption>Hey, you never know when you’re gonna need a terminal in Android.</figcaption></figure><h3>The spark that caused my weird design-with-code obsession</h3><p><strong>I stumbled upon the idea accidentally,</strong> but this weird interest grew out of some genuine frustration.</p><p>I wanted to try a couple of experiments with vertical video, seeing if I liked it and how comfortable I felt with the idea. The problem is, I wanted it to match my general style, which is strongly built around a heavily filtered grayscale imagery.</p><p>Every app I tried kind of sucked. CapCut, the ByteDance-produced app for creating TikTok videos, seemed unstable. A lot of other stuff came with spammy upsells. Plus I couldn’t <em>quite</em> get the design I wanted—a faded black and white look that’s a little pixelated, with a slightly choppy frame count.</p><p>The only thing I actually <em>liked</em> that could edit mobile videos was Canva. However, it could only get me so far. So, to fill the gap, I did something weird: I started testing whether I could filter videos with ffmpeg to my liking in Termux, the Linux terminal program for Android. Then, in a second step, I’d move the videos to Canva, to finish the edit (including adding the text in my desired font/design). And I’ll be damned, it worked:</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Cuyd8H2fvd4</p><p>I became curious about pushing this idea further, to social objects, and started working on tools to build quick graphics from Markdown files all on my phone—something you can make happen with HTML and CSS, basically. Cool idea, worked pretty simply:</p><p>I became curious about pushing this idea further, to social objects, and started working on tools to build quick graphics from Markdown files all on my phone—something you can make happen with HTML and CSS, basically.

He made this in Vim!</em></p><p>For the uninitiated, this is basically saying that you use scissors to cut a watermelon.</p><p>I will admit it was by a guy named “Vimjoyer” whose gimmick is basically doing everything with the popular text editor. (I personally use nano like a lamer.) But fortunately, the <em>how</em> behind it doesn’t need vim to be useful.</p><p>Essentially, he is using a tool called <a href=\"https://motioncanvas.io\">Motion Canvas</a> to push his content around so that he can create animations on the fly, shifting them around as desired. This is not totally dissimilar to what Flash could do with ActionScript back in the day, but it’s deconstructed so it’s code-first, GUI interface second.</p><p>I was curious, so I started messing around with it using the same on-my-phone format as the earlier ffmpeg experiment. Alas, Motion Canvas didn’t work all that well for such a constrained setting, as it required use of a browser. However, I spotted a similar tool, <a href=\"https://www.remotion.dev\">Remotion</a>, that worked entirely within the command line.</p><p>But one change precludes another—it needed <a href=\"https://playwright.dev\">Playwright</a>, a headless browser tool. As it’s made, that doesn’t work in Termux at all, as Playwright doesn’t have any builds compatible with Qualcomm chips. But I found <a href=\"https://github.com/Jobians/playwright-termux\">someone who had solved this exact problem</a>, and that let me do this:</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0hdZPTs-m0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>I can write the copy for these social objects in Markdown—even chain them together—and have it make a bunch of social objects for me, all meticulously set up in my style.</p><p>Sound like a lot of work to avoid working in a graphical interface? You bet your ass it is. On the plus side, you only really have to do a complex, repeatable task once (perhaps with some maintenance down the line).</p><p>But the thing is, you can use tools like Claude Code to make these sorts of weird connections work—and maybe tell them, after the agent insists you can’t run Playwright on your phone, that it’s actually possible. Then, if you want to dive in further, that’s when you take the time to learn it yourself and build upon the idea you’ve been conjuring.</p><p>(The trick I’ve been using lately: Tapping into the super-cheap DeepSeek Chat model via <a href=\"https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router\">Claude Code Router</a>, an implementation of Claude Code that lets you use models not made by Anthropic. That gives me additional room to screw around with oddball experiments like these, while being relatively minimal resource-wise. I put in $10 a month ago and have yet to run out, while still getting fairly decent results.)</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/y_uP4EdiU-vLNN7Ql7CkAqCp9g4=/1163x736/filters:quality(80)/uploads/typst_example.png\" width=\"1163\" height=\"736\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"typst_example.png\" /><figcaption>An example of what Typst can do. (via the Typst website)</figcaption></figure><h3>A new script for page layout</h3><p><strong>This is a very cool idea,</strong> and it’s more than just a novelty. I honestly believe this basic text-driven ideal could be taken to some amazing new frontiers. Lately, I’ve been fascinated by <a href=\"https://typst.app\">Typst</a>, a scripting technology that is seen as a competitor to LaTeX.</p><p>(Let me take a pause here to admit that LaTeX users have been designing with code for a long time. And there are probably some people who build stuff using PostScript they coded by hand. I bow before you, as a guy who started out as designer.)</p><p>It’s a tool that is designed for laying out technical documents, with an emphasis on things like math equations. But it could also be used to make all sorts of documents, like zines or even wall calendars. This is actually the perfect format to build a wall calendar, because it’s a highly templated format that can get very complex to manage in something like Affinity or InDesign. Here’s an example I built as a test:</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/WUIkVFv01MweNUOxGYdVf5dI3H4=/1000x669/filters:quality(80)/uploads/typst-calendar.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"typst-calendar.jpg\" /><figcaption>Longtime readers know that I have been threatening for years to sell a wall calendar, and 2027 might just be the year.</figcaption></figure><p>But it goes further than that. To me, I think there’s an opportunity to separate concerns inventively. For example: Let’s say you go into Affinity or Inkscape to build an SVG with the basic shape of your layout, or even a basic background, but then you import that graphic into Typst format. That moves you from texture to copy-layout. This is what I mean about separating concerns. Too often, design software tries to awkwardly mesh together these processes in a way that makes nobody happy.</p><p>Typst won’t get you all the way there, I will admit. It does not currently support blend modes, for example, meaning that you have to import raster graphics or SVGs to handle all of that. Same with clipping paths and masks. But I think there’s a world where Typst could have all of these things, making it an effective publishing tool without forcing you in canvas mode when you’d be better served by a framework.</p><p>We have a pretty good text-based web design framework in the form of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. With a few additions or some extensions, Typst could become that for print.</p><figure><img src=\"https://proxy.tedium.co/XvGwv0iSkvMwn9WVkgYsRYr6QOU=/1014x726/filters:quality(80)/uploads/mou.jpg\" width=\"1014\" height=\"726\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"mou.jpg\" /><figcaption>It’s too bad the creator of Mou disappeared and took his project’s goodwill with him, because this was a genuinely influential idea. The popular blogging platform Ghost was initially based off of this design.</figcaption></figure><h3>Graphic designers are secretly left-brained people</h3><p><strong>One thing that I think people don’t realize</strong> about graphic design, particularly the print form, is that it’s creativity, but there’s also math going on. It’s not that far removed from architecture, if you think about it.</p><p>Any newspaper designer will tell you about pica rulers and column inches until the cows come home. The secret about news design if that it’s a bunch of right-brained people who can think left-brained when the moment shows itself.</p><p>If you had asked me about this 15 years ago, I might have considered editorial design all right-brain thinking. But I think the left side of the brain was always there.</p><p>I think the thing that ultimately made this all click was probably Markdown, particularly an editor that presented the split in a way I couldn’t ignore. Fairly forgotten at this point, but deeply influential at the time, the 2010s-era MacOS Markdown editor <a href=\"https://spin.atomicobject.com/mou-for-markdown/\">Mou</a> basically let you lay out Markdown and see the visual output in real time. The story of Mou ended in tears—the designer basically <a href=\"https://x.com/25io/status/638270849829617665\">ghosted</a> a bunch of people after a <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/25ioinc/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you/\">crowdfunding campaign</a>—but it still inspired me, personally. (The popular open-source editor MacDown, recently revived as <a href=\"https://macdown.app\">MacDown 3000</a>, is something of a spiritual successor to the defunct Mou.)</p><p>I’ve been trying to figure out a way to convey all of this, probably, ever since I started ShortFormBlog in 2009. That site began with the provocative idea that you could design individual posts at a micro level rather than making absolutely everything look the same—as long as you were willing to give everything the right framework to work within.</p><p>We can translate that idea to all sorts of objects. We just need to think beyond the parameters in front of us. I’m not quite at the level of Vim video editor guy just yet, but it’s something to aspire to.</p></div><div class=\"graybox\"><h5>Non-Designy Links</h5><p><strong>I’ve been on the lookout</strong> for interesting tools that support Linux, and one I caught was <a href=\"https://neep.com\">Neep</a>, a paid tool that removes noise from voice calls. Krisp has this killer feature, too, but it doesn’t support Linux.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_HoMkkRHv8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>We’ve lost some great musicians of late,</strong> particularly Greg Brown, the original guitarist of Cake, who wrote “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_HoMkkRHv8\">The Distance</a>,” easily one of the best songs of the ’90s. Still hods up.
