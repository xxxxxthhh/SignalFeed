    "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Whenever one of my articles reaches some popularity, I tend not to participate in the discussion. A few weeks back, I told a story about <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/teaching-my-neighbor-to-keep-the-volume-down\">me, my neighbor and an UHF remote</a>. The story took on a life of its own on Hackernews before I could answer any questions. But reading through the comment section, I noticed a pattern on how comments form. People were not necessarily talking about my article. They had turned into factions.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>This isn't a complaint about the community. Instead it's an observation that I've made many years ago but didn't have the words to describe it. Now I have the articles to explore the idea.</p>\n\n<p>The article asked this question: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46848415\">is it okay to use a shared RF remote to silence a loud neighbor</a>? The comment section on hackernews split into two teams. Team Justice, who believed I was right to teach my neighbor a lesson. And then Team Boundaries, who believed I was “a real dick”. But within hours, the thread stopped being about that question. People self-sorted into tribes, not by opinion on the neighbor, but by identity.</p>\n\n<p>The tinkerers joined the conversation. If you only looked through the comment section without reading the article, you'd think it was a DIY thread on how to create an UHF remote. They turned the story into one about gadget showcasing. TV-B-Gone, Flipper Zeros, IR blasters on old phones, a guy using an HP-48G calculator as a universal remote. They didn't care about the neighbor. They cared about the hack.</p>\n\n<p>Then came the apartment warriors. They bonded over their shared suffering experienced when living in an apartment. Bad soundproofing, cheap landlords, one person even proposed a tool that doesn't exist yet, a \"spirit level for soundproofing\". The story was just a mirror for their own pain.</p>\n\n<p>The diplomats quietly pushed back on the whole premise. They talked about having shared WhatsApp groups, politely asking, and collective norms. A minority voice, but a distinct one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why hack someone when you can have a conversation?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Nostalgics drifted into memories of old tech. HAM radios, Magnavox TVs, the first time a remote replaced a channel dial. Generational gravity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Back in my days...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nobody decided to join these factions. They just replied to the comment that felt like their world, and the algorithm and thread structure did the rest. Give people any prompt, even a lighthearted one, and they will self-sort. Not into \"right\" and \"wrong,\" but into identity clusters. Morning people find morning people. Hackers find hackers. The frustrated find the frustrated. You discover your faction. And once you're in one, the comments from your own tribe just feel more natural to upvote.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>This pattern might be true for this article, but what about others? I have another article that has <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/18000-dollars-static-web-page\">gone viral twice</a>. On this one the question was: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19921386\">Is it ethical to bill $18k for a static HTML page?</a> </p>\n\n<p>Team Justice and Team Boundaries quickly showed up. \"You pay for time, not lines of code.\" the defenders argued. \"Silence while the clock runs is not transparent.\" the others criticized. But then the factions formed. People self-sorted into identity clusters, each cluster developed its own vocabulary and gravity, and the original question became irrelevant to most of the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Stories about money and professional life pull people downward into frameworks and philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>The pricing philosophers exploded into a deep rabbit hole on Veblen goods, price discrimination, status signaling, and perceived value. Referenced books, studies, and the \"I'm Rich\" iPhone app. This was the longest thread.</p>\n\n<p>The corporate cynics shared war stories about use-it-or-lose-it budgets, contractors paid to do nothing, and organizational dysfunction. Veered into a full government-vs-corporations debate that lasted dozens of comments.</p>\n\n<p>The professional freelancers dispensed practical advice. Invoice periodically, set scope boundaries, charge what you're worth. They drew from personal contractor experience.</p>\n\n<p>The ethicists genuinely wrestled with whether I did the right thing. Not just \"was it legal\" but \"was it honest.\" They were ignored.</p>\n\n<p>The psychology undergrads were fascinated by the story. Why do people Google during a repair job and get fired? Why does price change how you perceive quality? Referenced Cialdini's \"Influence\" and ran with it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Long story short, a jeweler was trying to move some turquoise and told an assistant to sell them at half price while she was gone. The assistant accidentally doubled the price, but the stones still sold immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The kind of drift between the two articles was different. The remote thread drifted laterally: people sorted by life experience and hobby (gadget lovers found gadget lovers, apartment sufferers found apartment sufferers). The $18k thread drifted deep: people sorted by intellectual framework (economists found economists, ethicists found ethicists, corporate cynics found corporate cynics). The $18k thread even spawned nested debates within subfactions. The Corporate Cynics thread turned into a full government-vs-corporations philosophical argument that had nothing to do with me or the article.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>But was all this something that just happens with my articles? I needed an answer. So I picked a recent article I enjoyed by <a href=\"https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-ai-adoption-journey\">Mitchell Hashimoto</a>. And it was about AI, so this was perfect to test if these patterns exist here as well.</p>\n\n<p>Now here is a respected developer who went from AI skeptic to someone who runs agents constantly. Without hype, without declaring victory, just documenting what worked. The question becomes: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46903558\">Is AI useful for coding, or is it hype?</a></p>\n\n<p>The result wasn't entirely binary. I spotted 3 groups at first. Those in favor said: \"It's a tool. Learn to use it well.\" Those against it said: \"It's slop. I'm not buying it.\" But then a third group. The fence-sitters (I'm in this group): \"Show me the data. What does it cost?\"</p>\n\n<p>And then the factions appeared.</p>\n\n<p>The workflow optimizers used the article as a premise to share their own agent strategy. Form an intuition on what the agent is good at, frame and scope the task so that it is hard for the AI to screw up, small diffs for faster human verification. </p>\n\n<p>The defenders of the craft dropped full on manifestos. “AI weakens the mind” then references The Matrix. \"I derive satisfaction from doing something hard.\" This group isn't arguing AI doesn't work. They're arguing it shouldn't work, because the work itself has intrinsic value.</p>\n\n<p>The history buffs joined the conversation. There was a riff on early aircraft being unreliable until the DC-3, then the 747. Architects moving from paper to CAD. They were framing AI adoption as just another tool transition in a long history of tool transitions. They're making AI feel inevitable, normal, obvious.</p>\n\n<p>The Appeal-to-Mitchell crowd stated that Mitchell is a better developer than you. If he gets value out of these tools you should think about why you can't. The flamewar kicked in! Someone joked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Why can't you be more like your brother Mitchell?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Vibe-code-haters added to the conversation. The term 'vibe coding' became a battleground. Some using it mockingly, some trying to redefine it. There was an argument that noted the split between this thread (pragmatic, honest) and LinkedIn (hyperbolic, unrealistic).</p>\n\n<p>A new variable from this thread was the author's credibility, plus he was replying in the threads. Unlike with my articles, the readers came to this thread with preconceived notions. If I claimed that I am now a full time vibe-coder, the community wouldn't care much. But not so with Mitchell.</p>\n\n<p>The quiet ones lose. The Accountants, the Fence-Sitters, they asked real questions and got minimal traction. \"How much does it cost?\" silence. \"Which tool should I use?\" minimal engagement. The thread's energy went to the factions that told a better story. </p>\n\n<p>One thing to note is that the Workflow Optimizers weren't arguing with the Skeptics. The Craft Defenders weren't engaging with the Accountants. Each faction found its own angle and stayed there. Just like the previous threads.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Three threads. Three completely different subjects: a TV remote story, an invoice story, an AI adoption guide. Every single one produced the same underlying architecture. A binary forms. Sub-factions drift orthogonally. The quiet ones get ignored. The entertaining factions win.</p>\n\n<p>The type of drift changes based on the article. Personal anecdotes (TV remote) pull people sideways into shared experience. Professional stories ($18k invoice) pull people down into frameworks. Prescriptive guides (AI adoption) pull people into tactics and philosophy. But the pattern, like the way people self-sort, the way factions ignore each other, the way the thread fractures, this remained the same.</p>\n\n<p>The details of the articles are not entirely relevant. Give any open-ended prompt to a comment section and watch the factions emerge. They're not coordinated. They're not conscious. They just... happen. For example, the Vibe-Code Haters faction emerged around a single term \"vibe coding.\" The semantic battle became its own sub-thread. Language itself became a faction trigger.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you spotted the pattern, you can't unsee it. That's factional drift.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

\nBecause of this, the back side of the PCB must be blank to avoid breaking the OLED display:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/screen2.jpg>\n<center>Wow, such component density.</center>\n</p><p>\n<em>The buttons</em> live on a tiny daughter board:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/buttons.jpg>\n</p><p>\nThese were a relatively late addition to the design, and are connected to the main PCB with a long ribbon cable.\nUnlike everything else, this board is actually screwed in to the case:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/front_case.jpg>\n</p><p>\n<em>The case itself</em> is 3D printed stainless steel, which is a reasonable choice for small volume products.\nHowever, the resulting metal is porous and hard to clean.\n(it's still an improvement over plastic in my book) \n</p><p>\nThe black tape is my doing: \nThis detector was one of the first (of this version) made and it had a loose screen:\nThe tape takes up just enough space to keep things tight.\n</p><p>\n<em>The bottom half</em> connects to the top with a short ribbon-cable:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/riser.jpg>\n</p><p>\nMost of the board space is taken up by the battery, which is held in place by an FDM printed bracket glued to the board:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/pcb.jpg>\n</p><p>\n<em>The battery is the</em> <a href=https://www.adafruit.com/product/4237>LP552530</a>, a tiny 350 mA hour lithium polymer cell. \nThis only provides a few hours of runtime, but there's only so much space in this thing.\n</p><p>\nThere are no components under the battery: \nall the detector's electronics are contained within the tiny 3x2 cm section above it.\n</p><p>\n<em>The detector</em> is hidden underneath the board:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/stack.jpg>\n</p><p>\nParticles enter through the back, travel through both mylar sheets and hit the white square of scintillator material.\nThe square converts the radiation's energy into a flash of light, which is detected by two photodiodes on the back side of the board. \n</p><p>\nTo keep out stray light, the scintillator is mounted in a ring of black rubber, which makes contact with black foam glued to the PCB and mylar. \nWhen assembled, the foam is compressed and creates a light-proof seal against the rubber.\n</p><p>\n<em>The scintillator</em> is a sandwich of two different materials:\nSilver dopped zinc sulfide painted onto polyvinyltoluene mixed with an organic phosphor (EJ-212).\n</p><p>\nThe zinc sulfide detects alpha particles, and the plastic scintillator detects beta. \nAlphas will produce a <a href=/projects/spinthariscope/>bright flash with a slow decay</a>, and betas produce a much faster and dimer flash.\nThe detector takes both of these factors into account to tell the difference between the two types of radiation.\n</p><p>\n<em>The MICROFC-60035-SMT-TR photodiodes</em> are very special:\nInstead of being a single photodiode, these SiPM's have an array of tiny reverse biased diodes:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/sipm.png>\n<center>In practice, the capacitors are connected to a low-Z output.</center>\n</p><p>\nEach diode is run above its usual breakdown voltage, but they don't start conducting immediately.\nHowever, once a free electron-hole pair is created, the electron is accelerated by the electric field and slams into silicon atoms.\nThese collisions are energetic enough to liberate more electrons: causing exponential \"avalanche\" breakdown.\n</p><p>\n<b>A single photon</b> is enough to make the diode start conducting. \n</p><p>\nIt's a similar principle to a G-M tube, just for visible light. \nJust like a G-M counter, the diode includes a quenching resistor which causes the voltage to drop once the discharge starts. \nThis resets the photodiode so it can continue detecting light.\n</p><p>\nThese detectors have quantum-limited performance &gt; 1 gigahertz bandwidth: \nsomething that's ordinarily <a href=https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/shining-light-on-photodiodes>super difficult to do</a>.\n</p><p>\nA single avalanche diode isn't able to measure the intensity of a light flash, but the SiPM contains thousands of them:\nThe amplitude of the output pulse depends on how many diodes are triggered, which is proportional to the brightness of the light.\n</p><p>\n<em>There's also a tiny LED</em> which is used for a self test:\nIf the SiPMs are able to pick up a dim LED flash, they should be able to pick up particle events.\n</p><p>\n<em>Ok, back to the board:</em>\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/map.jpg>\n<center>A map of the hound</center>\n</p><p>\n<em>The microcontroller is the ATSAMD21G18</em>, a 32-bit ARM processor capable of running at up to 48 MHz.\nThat might sound slow, but it's actually quite powerful for an embedded system:\nIt doesn't have to run chrome. \n</p><p>\n<em>The second largest chip is an ADXL335 accelerometer</em>. \nIn earlier versions, this was used to control the device, but is being phased out due to it's high cost.\n</p><p>\nMost of the other chips are too small to have a full part number printed on, but they are mostly voltage regulators, comparators and opamps. \n</p><p>\n<em>The top left</em> has a very standard boost converter: \n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/boost.png>\n</p><p>\nThis converts 3.3 volts into ~30 volts which is used to run the photodiodes. \n</p><p>\n<em>I don't currently have a way to strip off the conformal coating</em> covering it, so I can't trace out the pulse processing circuit. \nHowever, I'm quite confident it uses a peak detector circuit to measure the height of the pulse:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/theory1.png>\n<center>Theoretical pulse detection scheme: Don't look too closely.</center>\n</p><p>\nThis is a safe assumption because the microcontroller simply isn't fast enough to measure the 100 nanosecond scale pulses:\nThe ADC is only able to measure a voltage every ~3000 nanoseconds. \n</p><p>\nThe pulse shape discrimination is likely done by using an opamp integrator to time how long the pulse stays over a given threshold:\n</p><p>\n<img src=/misc/ah_teardown/theory2.png>\n<center>Theoretical PSD scheme: Don't look too closely.</center>\n</p><p>\nThis method produces similar pulse scatter plots to the real detector &mdash;\nincluding the distinctive curve of the alpha cluster &mdash;\nand is relatively simple...\n</p><p>\n... but I don't know if this is actually how it works. \n</p><p>\nThis section will be updated soon™.\n\n<!--\n<b>TODO: Get scope traces of pulse detector/discriminator circuit. </b>\nBetting it's using time-over-threshold.

Trump's antitrust agencies practiced \"boss politics antitrust\" in which favored courtiers were given free passes to violate the law, while Trump's enemies were threatened with punitive antitrust investigations until they fell into line:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/29/bondi-and-domination/#superjove\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/29/bondi-and-domination/#superjove</a></p>\n<p>Trump's antitrust boss Gail Slater talked a big game about \"Trump Antitrust\" but was thwarted at every turn by giant corporations who figured out that if they gave a million bucks to a MAGA podcaster, they could go over Slater's head and kill her enforcement actions. When Slater's deputy, Roger Alford, went public to denounce the sleazy backroom dealings that led to the approval of the HPE/Juniper merger, he was forced out of the agency altogether and replaced with a Pam Bondi loyalist who served as a kind of politburo political officer in Slater's agency:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abovethelaw.com/2025/08/former-maga-attorney-goes-scorched-earth-with-corruption-allegations-in-antitrust-division/\">https://abovethelaw.com/2025/08/former-maga-attorney-goes-scorched-earth-with-corruption-allegations-in-antitrust-division/</a></p>\n<p>Bondi made no secret of her contempt for Slater, and frequently humiliated her in public. Now it seems that Bondi has gotten tired of this game and has forced Slater out altogether. As ever, Matt Stoller has the best analysis of how this happened and what it means:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/trump-antitrust-chief-ousted-by-ticketmaster\">https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/trump-antitrust-chief-ousted-by-ticketmaster</a></p>\n<p>Stoller's main thesis is that the \"conservative populist\" movement only gained relevance by complaining about \"censorship of conservatives\" on the Big Tech platforms. While it's true that the platforms constitute an existential risk to free expression thanks to their chokehold over speech forums, it was always categorically <em>untrue</em> that conservatives were singled out by tech moderators:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen\">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen</a></p>\n<p>Conservative populists' grievance-based politics is in contrast with the progressive wing of the anti-monopoly movement, which was concerned with the idea of concentrated power itself, and sought to dismantle and neuter the power of the business lobby and the billionaires who ran it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/\">https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/</a></p>\n<p>The problem with conservative populism, then, is that its movement was propelled by the idea that Big Tech was soy and cucked and mean to conservatives. That meant that Big Tech bosses had an easy path out of its crosshairs: climb into the tank for MAGA.</p>\n<p>That's just what they did: Musk bought Twitter; Zuck ordered his content moderators to censor the left and push MAGA influencers; Bezos neutered his newspaper in the run up to the 2024 elections; Tim Cook hand-assembled a gold participation trophy for Trump live on camera. These CEOs paid a million dollars each for seats on Trump's inauguration dais and their companies donated millions for Trump's Epstein Memorial Ballroom.</p>\n<p>Slater's political assassination merely formalizes something that's been obvious for a year now: you can rip off the American people with impunity so long as you flatter and bribe Trump.</p>\n<p>The HP/Juniper merger means that one company now supplies the majority of commercial-grade wifi routers, meaning that one company now controls all the public, commercial, and institutional internet you'll ever connect to. The merger was worth $14b, and Trump's trustbusters promised to kill it. So the companies paid MAGA influencer Mike Davis (who had publicly opposed the merger) a million bucks and he got Trump to overrule his own enforcers. Getting your $14b merger approved by slipping a podcaster a million bucks is a hell of a bargain.</p>\n<p>HP/Juniper were first, but they weren't the last. There was the Discover/Capital One merger, which rolled up the two credit cards that low-waged people rely on the most, freeing the new company up for even more predatory practices, price-gouging, junk-fees, and strong-arm collections. When the bill collectors are at your door looking for thousands you owe from junk fees, remember that it was Gail Slater's weakness that sent them there:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/dealbook/capital-one-discover-merger.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/dealbook/capital-one-discover-merger.html</a></p>\n<p>Slater also waved through the rollup of a string of nursing homes by one of the world's most notoriously greedy and cruel private equity firms, KKR. When your grandma dies of dehydration in a dirty diaper, thank Gail Slater:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/09/dingo-babysitter/#maybe-the-dingos-ate-your-nan\">https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/09/dingo-babysitter/#maybe-the-dingos-ate-your-nan</a></p>\n<p>Slater approved the merger of Unitedhealth &#8211; a company notorious for overbilling the government while underdelivering to patients &#8211; with Amedisys, who provide hospice care and home health help:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-broad-divestitures-resolve-challenge-unitedhealths-acquisition\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-broad-divestitures-resolve-challenge-unitedhealths-acquisition</a></p>\n<p>The hits keep coming. Want to know why your next vacation was so expensive? Thank Slater for greenlighting the merger of American Express Global Business Travel and CWT Holdings, which Slater challenged but then dropped, reportedly because MAGA influencer Mike Davis told her to.</p>\n<p>Davis also got Slater to reverse her opposition to the Compass/Anywhere Real Estate merger, which will make America's dysfunctional housing market even worse:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/real-estate-brokerages-avoided-merger-investigation-after-justice-department-rift-e846c797?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdSXg4z1XPl2UpqdHR4V2-sNj9M7oDcWHscPIXuSU-5n0gtYEv8Q5XZG7qtzfY%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=698e44a6&amp;amp;gaa_sig=IO7tWGaHZSYER64YyUzyoiVtrOKR77ZsYMMOdwN1P7koRt9zXYRJ1hxw2oDU9cD40-aGgHHVfwMWg14olFwNaw%3D%3D\">https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/real-estate-brokerages-avoided-merger-investigation-after-justice-department-rift-e846c797?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdSXg4z1XPl2UpqdHR4V2-sNj9M7oDcWHscPIXuSU-5n0gtYEv8Q5XZG7qtzfY%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=698e44a6&amp;amp;gaa_sig=IO7tWGaHZSYER64YyUzyoiVtrOKR77ZsYMMOdwN1P7koRt9zXYRJ1hxw2oDU9cD40-aGgHHVfwMWg14olFwNaw%3D%3D</a></p>\n<p>It's not just homebuyers whose lives are worse off because of Slater's failures, it's tenants, too. Slater settled the DoJ's case against Realpage, a price-fixing platform for landlords that is one of the most culpable villains in the affordability crisis. Realpage was facing an existential battle with the DoJ; instead, they got away with a wrist-slap and (crucially) are allowed to continue to make billions helping landlords rig the rental market against tenants.</p>\n<p>So Slater's defenestration is really just a way of formalizing Trump's approach to antitrust: threaten and prosecute companies that don't bend the knee to the president, personally&#8230;and allow companies to rob the American people with impunity if they agree to kick up a percentage to the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>But while Slater will barely rate a footnote in the history of the Trump administration, the precipitating event for her political execution is itself <em>very</em> interesting. Back in September, Trump posed with Kid Rock and announced that he was going after Ticketmaster/Live Nation, a combine with a long, exhaustively documented history of ripping off and defrauding every entertainer, fan and venue in America:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/ftc-sues-ticketmaster-saying-it-uses-illegal-tactics-to-make-fans-pay-more-for-live-events\">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/ftc-sues-ticketmaster-saying-it-uses-illegal-tactics-to-make-fans-pay-more-for-live-events</a></p>\n<p>At the time, it was clear that Trump had been prodded into action by two factors: the incredible success of the Mamdani campaign's focus on \"affordability\" (Ticketmaster's above-inflation price hikes are one of the most visible symptoms of the affordability crisis) and Kid Rock's personal grievances about Ticketmaster.</p>\n<p>Kid Rock is the biggest-name entertainer in the Trump coalition, the guy Trump got to headline a MAGA halftime show that notably failed to dim Bad Bunny's star by a single milliwatt. Trump &#8211; a failed Broadway producer &#8211; is also notoriously susceptible to random pronouncements by celebrities (hence the Fox and Friends-to-Trump policy pipeline), so it's natural that Kid Rock's grousing got action after decades of documented abuses went nowhere.</p>\n<p>Ticketmaster could have solved the problem by offering to exempt Trump-loyal entertainers from its predatory practices. They could have announced a touring Trumpapalooza festival headlined by Kid Rock, Christian rock acts, and AI-generated country singers, free from all junk fees. Instead, they got Gail Slater fired.</p>\n<p>Mike Davis doesn't just represent HPE/Juniper, Amex travel, and Compass/Anywhere &#8211; he's also the fixer that Ticketmaster hired to get off the hook with the DoJ. He's boasting about getting Slater fired:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/gekaminsky/status/2022076364279755066\">https://x.com/gekaminsky/status/2022076364279755066</a></p>\n<p>And Ticketmaster is off the hook:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prospect.org/2026/02/12/trump-justice-department-ticketmaster-live-nation-monopoly/\">https://prospect.org/2026/02/12/trump-justice-department-ticketmaster-live-nation-monopoly/</a></p>\n<p>What's interesting about all this is that there were elements of the Biden coalition that <em>also</em> hated antitrust (think of all the Biden billionaires who called for Lina Khan to be fired while serving as \"proxies\" for Kamala Harris). And yet, Biden's trustbusters did more in four short years than their predecessors managed over the preceding forty.</p>\n<p>Stoller's theory is that the progressive anti-monopoly movement (the \"Brandeisians\") were able to best their coalitional rivals because they did the hard work of winning support for the idea of shattering corporate power itself &#8211; not just arguing that corporate power was bad when it was used against them.</p>\n<p>This was a slower, harder road than dividing up the world into good monopolies and bad ones, but it paid off. Today the Brandeisians who made their bones under Biden are serving the like of Mamdani:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/15/unconscionability/#standalone-authority\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/15/unconscionability/#standalone-authority</a></p>\n<p>And their ideas have spread far and wide &#8211; even to other countries:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lewisforleader.ca/ideas/public-options-full-plan/\">https://lewisforleader.ca/ideas/public-options-full-plan/</a></p>\n<p>They lit a fire that burns still. Who knows, maybe someday it'll even help Kid Rock scorch the Ticketmaster ticks that are draining his blood from a thousand tiny wounds. He probably won't have the good manners to say thank you.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\n<h1 heds=\"0\">Hey look at this (<a

Every codebase of sufficient age accumulates these. They&apos;re documented, acknowledged, and largely left alone so the engineers can go build something useful.</p><p>Note (and this is important): you are a codebase of sufficient age.</p><p>The self-help industry&apos;s entire business model depends on convincing you that every single bug in your system is fixable, that with the right framework, the right habits, the right coach, you&apos;ll finally refactor yourself into a clean, well-architected human being. But how many of your core personality traits have actually changed in the last decade?</p><p>The honest answer, for most people, is...very fucking few.</p><h2 id=\"why-refactoring-yourself-is-a-terrible-use-of-resources\">Why refactoring yourself is a terrible use of resources</h2><p>Fred Brooks observed that when engineers build the second version of a system, they tend to over-design it, cramming in every feature and fix they wished they&apos;d included the first time. The result is almost always bloated, late, and worse than what it replaced. The lesson developers have extracted from fifty years of living with Brooks&apos;s observation is simple: don&apos;t rewrite from scratch, and work with what you have.</p><p>Self-improvement culture is a perpetual second-system rewrite of the self. You&apos;re constantly trying to architect Human 2.0, the version of you that&apos;s disciplined and calm and focused and doesn&apos;t check their phone 96 times a day (which is, by the way, the actual average for American adults, according to Asurion&apos;s widely cited research). But Human 2.0 never ships. You keep accumulating half-finished refactors and abandoned meditation streaks alongside a growing sense that something is fundamentally wrong with your willpower.</p><p>The alternative is the wrapper pattern. When you have a piece of legacy code that works but has an ugly interface, you don&apos;t rewrite it. You write a thin layer around it, a wrapper, that presents a clean interface to the rest of the system while leaving the messy internals untouched. The legacy code keeps doing what it always did, and the wrapper translates between the old system and the new requirements.</p><h2 id=\"what-wrappers-look-like-in-practice\">What wrappers look like in practice</h2><p>The Acceptance camp says: release your attachment to punctuality. The Optimization camp says: build a 47-step morning routine with buffer time calculated to the minute. Won&apos;t Fix says: you&apos;re going to be late, so build a wrapper. Tell people 2 PM when you mean 2:30. Set your clocks ahead. Automate your calendar reminders to fire 15 minutes earlier than the defaults. You haven&apos;t changed yourself, but you&apos;ve written an adapter layer between your actual personality and the world&apos;s expectations.</p><p>Epictetus, who spent years as a slave in Rome before gaining his freedom and building one of the most influential schools of Stoic philosophy, would probably say that this approach surrenders moral agency. You&apos;re supposed to <em>become</em> virtuous, not fake it with systems. And there&apos;s something to that objection.</p><p>But Epictetus also spent most of his philosophy drawing sharp lines between what you can and can&apos;t control. Is your core temperament something you control? The Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) show remarkable stability across adult lifespans, according to decades of longitudinal research in personalty psychology. You can nudge them, but you can&apos;t overhaul them.</p><p>If Epictetus were working in DevOps, I suspect he&apos;d be a wrapper advocate.</p><h2 id=\"giving-up-correctly-is-its-own-liberation\">Giving up correctly is its own liberation</h2><p>In Kazuo Ishiguro&apos;s <em>The Remains of the Day</em> Stevens, the butler, reflects on the decades he spent perfecting his professional dignity at the expense of, well, everthing else. His entire life was a refactoring project: eliminate the personal, optimize for service, become the ideal version of what a butler should be. By the end of the novel he&apos;s technically excellent and profoundly diminished. He optimized the wrong thing for forty years because he never stopped to ask whether the specification itself was flawed.</p><p>Won&apos;t Fix is the practice of questioning the specification. Most of the things you&apos;re trying to fix about yourself are only problems relative to some imagined ideal of a person you were never going to be. Your distractibility is a bug in the &quot;focused knowledge worker&quot; spec but might be a feature in the &quot;person who notices interesting things and connects them unexpectedly&quot; spec. Your sensitivity and your stubbornness, your tendency to monologue about niche topics at parties: all Won&apos;t Fix, and all load-bearing, and all probably okay in the big, heat-death-of-the-universe scheme of all things. </p><p>Stop trying to ship Human 2.0. Tag the bugs, write the wrappers, and get back to building something worth building. The most productive version of you probably looks a lot like the current version of you, plus a few well-placed adapter patterns and minus about thirty self-help books worth of guilt about not being somone else.</p>",

    "title": "Respectful Open Source",
    "link": "https://nesbitt.io/2026/02/13/respectful-open-source.html",
    "content": "<p>I found and fixed a bug in a popular open source project last week. Went to look at the repository and saw a maintainer drowning in issues and pull requests, clearly underwater, and I didn’t submit the fix.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been on both sides of this for a long time. I ran <a href=\"https://github.com/24pullrequests/24pullrequests\">24 Pull Requests</a> for years, a project that actively encouraged people to send PRs to open source maintainers every December. The incoming was so overwhelming that I ended up building <a href=\"https://github.com/octobox/octobox\">Octobox</a> just to help maintainers manage the flood of GitHub notifications. I’ve spent a decade building tools to help maintainers cope with inbound, and I still couldn’t bring myself to add to someone else’s pile.</p>\n\n<p>When I mentioned this on Mastodon, most people got it immediately. A couple said send it anyway, which I think misses something about what it’s like to be on the receiving end. A fix from a stranger still carries cognitive load beyond just merging: triage, review, checking for regressions, responding, managing expectations when you can’t get to it quickly. And once you merge someone’s code, you’re maintaining it. They move on, but you’re the one who gets the bug report a year later when something breaks in a way the original patch didn’t anticipate.</p>\n\n<p>Even a perfect PR with a note saying “no rush” creates a low-grade obligation the moment it appears. The maintainer now knows it exists, unanswered. Someone in the thread suggested framing it as a gift with no expectations, and another person put it well: it doesn’t matter how carefully you word it, it still lands as a thing that needs a decision.</p>\n\n<p>The fix exists on my fork. If discovery were good, anyone hitting the same bug could find it there, but nobody will because fork discovery is effectively broken.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"git-was-pull-based\">Git was pull-based</h3>\n\n<p>The open source contribution model is almost entirely push-based. You do the work, then you push it at a maintainer and wait. Issues, PRs, @mentions, automated updates, audit findings, all of it puts something in front of a person who didn’t ask for it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git request-pull</code></a> generates a summary of changes in your repo and asks someone to pull from it, a genuine peer-to-peer request where the maintainer decides if and when to look. The contributor publishes their work and the maintainer pulls at their own pace, which is about as respectful of someone’s attention as a collaboration model gets. GitHub took that name and bolted it onto what is functionally a push-based review queue. GitLab is at least honest about it by calling them merge requests.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody can really use the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">git request-pull</code> workflow anymore because it depends on the other person being able to find and browse your repo, which is a discovery problem that doesn’t have good answers right now. If the default were flipped so that fixes exist publicly without requiring maintainer attention, the contributor’s job would be done when the fix is public rather than when it’s merged, and other users could find and benefit from fixes independently of upstream.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fork-discovery-is-broken\">Fork discovery is broken</h3>\n\n<p>The best tools for fork discovery are a handful of browser extensions that filter GitHub’s fork list to show forks with commits ahead of upstream, and the most ambitious one I found clones all forks into a single repo and lets you grep across them locally.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub made forking easy and fork discovery nearly impossible. The old fork graph rarely works for popular repos because so many people use the fork button as a bookmark, and Dependabot, CI bots, and AI agents all generate forks that are nothing but noise. Someone in the thread mentioned installing a browser plugin just to look at forks.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub have said they’ll let maintainers turn off PRs on their repos, which makes sense as a pressure valve, but turning off PRs without an alternative channel doesn’t make fixes discoverable elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>It might be more interesting to pair that switch with better discovery. Imagine a maintainer triaging issue #347 and being able to see “three forks have patches touching this code” without anyone having submitted anything, because the signal is already there in git, just not surfaced anywhere.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"everything-is-push\">Everything is push</h3>\n\n<p>PRs are just the most visible channel. Bug reports, feature requests, support questions, and bot-generated updates all land in the same inbox with the same zero friction and the same assumption that someone on the other end has time to look at them.</p>\n\n<p>Compliance and audit requests add another layer, where someone runs a scanner, finds something, and opens an issue that reads like a demand. “Your project has a licensing problem.” “This code has a known vulnerability.” The maintainer didn’t ask for the audit, didn’t agree to the compliance framework, and is now expected to respond on someone else’s timeline. With the EU CRA pushing more software supply chain accountability, there’s a growing class of inbound that amounts to “prove to me that your free software meets my requirements,” which is a lot to push at a volunteer.</p>\n\n<p>Private vulnerability disclosure is different because it needs a direct channel by nature, and that channel has its own AI spam crisis as anyone following curl’s experience with HackerOne can attest. But for everything else, the problem isn’t bad faith on anyone’s part, it’s that every one of these interactions assumes the maintainer has capacity to receive, and there’s no mechanism for them to control that.</p>\n\n<p>Open source sustainability conversations tend to focus on money, and maintainers absolutely need more of it, but maintainer attention and mental health are at least as scarce a resource, and nobody’s trying to conserve them. Miranda Heath’s <a href=\"https://mirandaheath.website/report-on-burnout-in-open-source-software/\">report on burnout in open source</a> names six causes, and workload is only one of them: toxic community behaviour, hyper-responsibility, and the pressure to keep proving yourself all compound the problem. The <a href=\"https://www.joanwestenberg.com/communities-are-not-fungible/\">communities around projects aren’t fungible</a> either, built on years of shared context and ambient trust that can’t be rebuilt once the people holding them together burn out. Unsolicited PRs, drive-by issues, and automated audits are all withdrawals from a finite account. A pull model, where people log problems and publish fixes somewhere discoverable and the maintainer engages on their own schedule, would at least stop treating that account as bottomless.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ai-slop-accelerates-the-problem\">AI slop accelerates the problem</h3>\n\n<p>All of this was already a problem before AI coding agents, but the past six months have made it noticeably worse. The volume of low-quality inbound to popular projects has exploded. Daniel Stenberg watched <a href=\"https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/2025-05-curl_vs_ai_with_daniel_stenberg/\">AI-generated reports grow to 20% of curl’s bug bounty submissions</a> through 2025, added a checkbox requiring AI disclosure, then finally killed the bounty program entirely in January 2026 after receiving seven submissions in sixteen hours. <a href=\"https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md\">Ghostty implemented a policy</a> where submitting bad AI-generated code gets you permanently banned. <a href=\"https://tldraw.dev/blog/stay-away-from-my-trash\">tldraw stopped accepting external PRs altogether</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These are experienced maintainers who tried graduated responses and ended up at the nuclear option because nothing else worked. The <a href=\"https://dri.es/ai-creates-asymmetric-pressure-on-open-source\">pattern</a> is the same every time: add disclosure requirements, then add friction, then restrict access, then close the door, with each step costing maintainer energy on policy rather than code. That might work for individual projects, but it’s hard to see it scaling when the number of potential contributors becomes effectively infinite and the tooling to generate plausible-looking code keeps getting better. And if GitHub’s answer is letting maintainers turn off PRs entirely, AI pressure is going to force that switch on more and more repos, which only widens the discovery gap. GitHub made forking a one-click operation a decade ago without ever investing in making the resulting graph navigable, and now that turning off PRs is becoming a reasonable response to the AI firehose, all those would-be contributions just pile up as diverging forks that nobody can find.</p>\n\n<p>A pull-based model would sidestep most of this, because agents can fork and generate garbage all day without anything landing in anyone’s inbox. The maintainer never has to evaluate it, write a policy about it, or spend emotional energy closing it with a polite note. Generated code that happens to be good sits in a fork where someone might eventually find it useful, and the rest is invisible.</p>\n\n<p>The empathy of not adding to the pile, the choice to fix something and walk away, is invisible in open source sustainability discussions, and I suspect the contributions people deliberately don’t make out of respect for maintainer capacity might matter just as much as the ones they do. The fix is on my fork, and for now that’s where it stays.</p>",

Once we reach the singularity, If we have the same motivations we have now — primarily power over people — things are going to be horrific” – George Hotz</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How is everyone enjoying their singularity? How far is this going to go? Why are we letting the minds that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqH7PPC_J1c\">invented fastpass</a> run things? Who are we doing this all for again?</p>\n\n<p>We live in a society. It seems a lot of people have forgotten this. So much stuff that’s being built just shouldn’t be built. You know technology could be good, right? It could all be <a href=\"https://craigslist.org\">like this</a> and <a href=\"https://shein.com\">not like this</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Is everyone individually too weak to defect? Sounds like we need a revolution.</p>",
