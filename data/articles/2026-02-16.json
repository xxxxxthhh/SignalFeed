    "content": "<p>At the recent \"<a href=\"https://protocolsforpublishers.com/\">Protocols for Publishers</a>\" event, a group of us were talking about news paywalls, social media promotion, and the embarrassment of having to ask for money.</p>\n\n<p>What if, we said, you could tip a journalist directly on social media? Or reward your favourite creator without leaving the platform? Or just say thanks by buying someone a pint?</p>\n\n<p>Here's a trivial mock-up:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Tip-page.webp\" alt=\"Mock up of a Mastodon post. There's a a £ button next to boost. It offers the options to tip the suggested amount £0.15, or to tip a custom amount.\" width=\"998\" height=\"541\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67671\">\n\n<p>Of course, this hides a ton of complexity. Does it show your local currency symbol? Does the platform take a cut or does it just pass you to the poster's preferred platform? Do users want to be able to tip as well as / instead of reposting and favouriting?</p>\n\n<p>But I think the real problem is the perverse incentives it creates. We already know that relentless A|B testing of monetisation strategies leads to homogeneity and outrage farming. Every YouTuber has the same style of promotional thumbnail. Rage-baiters on Twitter know what drives the algorithm and pump out unending slurry.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we ignore those who want to burn the world, content stealers like @CUTE_PUPP1E5 grab all the content they can and rip-off original creators. At the moment that's merely annoying, but monetisation means a strong incentive to steal content.</p>\n\n<p>When people inevitably get scammed, would that damage the social media platform? Would promoting a payment link lead to liability? Now that money is involved, does that make hacking more attractive?</p>\n\n<p>And yet… Accounts add payment links to their profiles all the time. Lots of accounts regularly ask for donor and sponsors. GitHub sponsors exist and I don't see evidence of people impersonating big projects and snaffling funds.</p>\n\n<p>It is somewhat common for platforms to pay for publishers to be on their site. If you're starting up a new service then you need to give people an incentive to be there. That might be as a payer or receiver.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I'd love a frictionless way to throw a quid to a helpful blog post, or effortlessly donate to a poster who has made me laugh. Selfishly, I'd like it if people paid me for my Open Source or (micro)blogging.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know whether Mastodon or BlueSky will ever have a payments button - and I have no influence on their decision-making process - but I'd sure like to see them experiement.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Edent/116023582888695517\">read more discussion on Mastodon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Or, feel free to send me a tip!</p>\n\n<ul id=\"review-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/13GFCFR2B2IX4?type=wishlist&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=shksprblogwish-21\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=amazon.co.uk\" width=\"20\">Buy me a gift from my Amazon wishlist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/edent\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=github.com\" width=\"20\">Sponsor me on GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://paypal.me/edent/gbp1\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=paypal.com\" width=\"20\">Send me money via PayPal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/edent\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=ko-fi.com\" width=\"20\">Support me on Ko-Fi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://patreon.com/edent\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=patreon.com\" width=\"20\">Become a Patreon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/edent\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=opencollective.com\" width=\"20\">Join my Open Collective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://liberapay.com/edent\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=liberapay.com\" width=\"20\">Donate using LiberaPay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wise.com/pay/me/terencee51\"><img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/favicons/?domain=wise.com\" width=\"20\">Pay with Wise</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

    "link": "https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/15/chebyshev-bias/",
    "content": "<p>The last few posts have looked at expressing an odd prime <em>p</em> as a sum of two squares. This is possible if and only if <em>p</em> is of the form 4<em>k</em> + 1. I illustrated an algorithm for finding the squares with <em>p</em> = 2<sup>255</sup> − 19, a prime that is used in cryptography. It is being used in bringing this page to you if the TLS connection between my server and your browser is uses Curve25519 or Ed25519.</p>\n<h2>World records</h2>\n<p>I thought about illustrating the algorithm with a larger prime too, such as a world record. But then I realized all the latest record primes have been of the form 4<em>k</em> + 3 and so cannot be written as a sum of squares. Why is <em>p</em> mod 4 equal to 3 for all the records? Are more primes congruent to 3 than to 1 mod 4? The answer to that question is subtle; more on that shortly.</p>\n<p>More record primes are congruent to 3 mod 4 because Mersenne primes are easier to find, and that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s an algorithm, the Lucas-Lehmer test, that can test whether a Mersenne number is prime more efficiently than testing general numbers. Lucas developed his test in 1878 and Lehmer refined it in 1930.</p>\n<p>Since the time Lucas first developed his test, the largest known prime has always been a Mersenne prime, with exceptions in 1951 and in 1989.</p>\n<h2>Chebyshev bias</h2>\n<p>So, are more primes congruent to 3 mod 4 than are congruent to 1 mod 4?</p>\n<p>Define the function <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) to be the ratio of the number of primes in each residue class.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = (# primes <em>p</em> &lt; <em>n</em> with <em>p</em> = 3 mod 4) / (# primes <em>p</em> &lt; <em>n</em> with <em>p</em> = 1 mod 4)</p>\n<p>As <em>n</em> goes to infinity, the function <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) converges to 1. So in that sense the number of primes in each category are equal.</p>\n<p>If we look at the difference rather than the ratio we get a more subtle story. Define the lead function to be how much the count of primes equal to 3 mod 4 leads the number of primes equal to 1 mod 4.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>g</em>(<em>n</em>) = (# primes <em>p</em> &lt; <em>n</em> with <em>p</em> = 3 mod 4) − (# primes <em>p</em> &lt; <em>n</em> with <em>p</em> = 1 mod 4)</p>\n<p>For any <em>n</em>, <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) &gt; 1 if and only if <em>g</em>(<em>n</em>) &gt; 0. However, as <em>n</em> goes to infinity the function <em>g</em>(<em>n</em>) does not converge. It oscillates between positive and negative infinitely often. But <em>g</em>(<em>n</em>) is positive for long stretches. This phenomena is known as Chebyshev bias.</p>\n<h2>Visualizing the lead function</h2>\n<p>We can calculate the lead function at primes with the following code.</p>\n<pre>from numpy import zeros\nfrom sympy import primepi, primerange\n\nN = 1_000_000\nleads = zeros(primepi(N) + 1)\nfor index, prime in enumerate(primerange(2, N), start=1):\n    leads[index] = leads[index - 1] + prime % 4 - 2\n</pre>\n<p>Here is a list of the primes at which the lead function is zero, i.e. when it changes sign.</p>\n<pre>[   0,     1,     3,     7,    13,    89,  2943,  2945,  2947,\n 2949,  2951,  2953, 50371, 50375, 50377, 50379, 50381, 50393,\n50413, 50423, 50425, 50427, 50429, 50431, 50433, 50435, 50437,\n50439, 50445, 50449, 50451, 50503, 50507, 50515, 50517, 50821,\n50843, 50853, 50855, 50857, 50859, 50861, 50865, 50893, 50899,\n50901, 50903, 50905, 50907, 50909, 50911, 50913, 50915, 50917,\n50919, 50921, 50927, 50929, 51119, 51121, 51123, 51127, 51151,\n51155, 51157, 51159, 51161, 51163, 51177, 51185, 51187, 51189,\n51195, 51227, 51261, 51263, 51285, 51287, 51289, 51291, 51293,\n51297, 51299, 51319, 51321, 51389, 51391, 51395, 51397, 51505,\n51535, 51537, 51543, 51547, 51551, 51553, 51557, 51559, 51567,\n51573, 51575, 51577, 51595, 51599, 51607, 51609, 51611, 51615,\n51617, 51619, 51621, 51623, 51627]\n</pre>\n<p>This is OEIS sequence <a href=\"https://oeis.org/A038691\">A038691</a>.</p>\n<p>Because the lead function changes more often in some regions than others, it&#8217;s best to plot the function over multiple ranges.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/chebbias1.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" /></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/chebbias2.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" /></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/chebbias3.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/chebbias4.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://www.johndcook.com/chebbias5.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" /></p>\n<p>The lead function is more often positive than negative.
