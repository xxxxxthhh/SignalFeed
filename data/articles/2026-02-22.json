OpenAI will then invest $300 billion in Oracle, then Oracle invests back into Nvidia. Now, Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, is back tracking and saying he <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/02/jensen-huang-nvidia-ceo-on-openai-investment-never-a-commitment/\">never made that commitment</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“It was never a commitment. They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So he never committed? Did we make up all these graphs in our head? Was it a misquote from a journalist somewhere that sparkled all this frenzy? Well, you can take a look in <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/\">OpenAI press release in September of 2025</a>. They wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact, Jensen Huang went on to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT. This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds like Jensen is distancing himself from that $100 billion commitment. Did he take a peak inside OpenAI and change his mind? At the same time, OpenAI is experimenting with ads. Sam Altman stated before that they would only ever use ads as a last resort. It sounds like we are in the phase. </p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

    "link": "https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/MentionLittleScripts",
    "content": "<div class=\"wikitext\"><p>I have a habit of writing little scripts at work for my own use\n(perhaps like some number of my readers). They pile up like snowdrifts\nin my $HOME/adm, except they don't melt away when their time is\ndone but stick around even when they're years obsolete. Every so\noften I mention one of them to my co-workers; sometimes my co-workers\naren't interested, but sometimes they find the script appealing and\nhave me put it into our shared location for 'production' scripts\nand programs. Sometimes, these production-ized scripts have turned\nout to be very useful.</p>\n\n<p>(Not infrequently, having my co-workers ask me to move something\ninto 'production' causes me to revise it to make it less of a weird\nhack. Occasionally this causes <a href=\"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/ToolsOneachII\">drastic changes that significantly\nimprove the script</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>When I say that I mentioned my scripts to my co-workers, that makes\nit sound more intentional than it often is. A common pattern is\nthat I'll use one of my scripts to get some results that I share,\nand then my co-workers will ask how I did it and I'll show them the\ncommand line, and then they'll ask things like \"what is this\n~cks/adm/&lt;program> thing' and 'can you put that somewhere more\naccessible, it sounds handy'. I do sometimes mention scripts\nunprompted, if I think they're especially useful, but I've written\na lot of scripts over time and many of them aren't of much use for\nanyone beside me (or at least, I think they're too weird to be\nshared).</p>\n\n<p>If you have your own collection of scripts, maybe your co-workers\nwould find some of them useful. It probably can't hurt to mention\nsome of them every so often. You do have to mention specific scripts;\nin my experience 'here is a directory of scripts with a README\ncovering what's there' doesn't really motivate people to go look.\nMentioning a specific script with what it can do for people is the\nway to go, especially if you've just used the script to deal with\nsome situation.</p>\n\n<p>(One possible downside of doing this is the amount of work you may\nneed to do in order to turn your quick hack into something that can\nbe operated and maintained by other people over the longer term.\nIn some cases, <a href=\"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/ToolsOneachII\">you may need to completely rewrite things</a>, preserving the ideas but not the implementation.)</p>\n\n<p>PS: Speaking from personal experience, don't try to write a README\nfor your $HOME/adm unless you're the sort of diligent person who\nwill keep it up to date as you add, change, and ideally remove\nscripts. My $HOME/adm's README is more than a decade out of date.</p>\n</div>\n<div> (<a href=\"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/MentionLittleScripts?showcomments#comments\">3 comments</a>.) </div>",

    "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve written before about <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/08/computing-large-fibonacci-numbers/\">computing big Fibonacci numbers</a>, and about creating a <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/05/fibonacci-certificate/\">certificate</a> to verify a Fibonacci number has been calculated correctly. This post will revisit both, giving a different approach to computing big Fibonacci numbers that produces a certificate along the way.</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, I&#8217;m not aware of any practical reason to compute large Fibonacci numbers. However, the process illustrates techniques that are practical for other problems.</p>\n<p>The fastest way to compute the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number for sufficiently large <em>n</em> is Binet’s formula:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = round( φ<sup><em>n</em></sup> / √5 )</p>\n<p>where φ is the golden ratio. The point where <em>n</em> is &#8220;sufficiently large&#8221; depends on your hardware and software, but in my experience I found the crossover to be somewhere 1,000 and 10,000.</p>\n<p>The problem with Binet&#8217;s formula is that it requires extended precision floating point math. You need extra guard digits to make sure the integer part of your result is entirely correct. How many guard digits you&#8217;ll need isn&#8217;t obvious <em>a priori</em>. <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/08/computing-large-fibonacci-numbers/\">This post</a> gave a way of <em>detecting</em> errors, and it could be turned into a method for <em>correcting</em> errors.</p>\n<p>But how do we know an error didn&#8217;t slip by undetected? This question brings us back to the idea of certifying a Fibonacci number. A number <em>f</em> Fibonacci number if and only if one of 5<em>f</em><sup>2</sup> ± 4 is a perfect square.</p>\n<p>Binet&#8217;s formula, implemented in finite precision, takes a positive integer <em>n</em> and gives us a number <em>f</em> that is approximately the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number. Even in low-precision arithmetic, the <em>relative</em> error in the computation is small. And because the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers is approximately φ, an approximation to <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is far from the Fibonacci numbers <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em> − 1</sub> and <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub>. So the closest Fibonacci number to an approximation of <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> is exactly <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>.</p>\n<p>Now if <em>f</em> is approximately <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, then 5<em>f</em><sup>2</sup> is approximately a square. Find the integer <em>r</em> minimizing  |5<em>f</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>r</em>²|. In Python you could do this with the <code>isqrt</code> function. Then either <em>r</em>² + 4 or <em>r</em>² − 4 is divisible by 5. You can know which one by looking at <em>r</em>² mod 5. Whichever one is, divide it by 5 and you have the square of <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>. You can take the square root exactly, in integer arithmetic, and you have <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>. Furthermore, the number <em>r</em> that you computed along the way is the certificate of the calculation of <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>.</p>The post <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2026/02/21/big-certified-fibonacci/\">Computing big, certified Fibonacci numbers</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.johndcook.com/blog\">John D.

about <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-california-turned-against-growth\">California&#8217;s pivot to anti-growth</a> in the 1960s, I noted how Prop 13, which cut property taxes and locked in extremely low tax rates, cemented the opposition to growth that had been rising since the 1960s, and that there were similar &#8220;tax revolts&#8221; in states across the country. Now it seems like opposition to property tax is gaining traction again: Florida&#8217;s house of representatives just passed a bill that would remove non-school property taxes for all &#8220;homesteaded properties&#8221; (which, as I understand it, basically means primary residences). [<a href=\"https://floridaphoenix.com/2026/02/19/florida-house-passes-proposed-amendment-to-immediately-phase-out-property-taxes/\">Florida Phoenix</a>]</p><h4><strong>Manufacturing</strong></h4><p>The Rhodium Group has a good article breaking down why Chinese EVs are so cheap. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be about labor productivity (which is lower than Western firms), or subsidies. Instead, the advantage mostly comes from the level of vertical integration they&#8217;re operating at. &#8220;For BYD, vertical integration is the single most important factor behind the company&#8217;s price advantage. That said, even among Chinese OEMs, BYD and Leapmotor are outliers. This helps explain why BYD has been among the companies most consistently leading price decreases over 2024 and 2025. Vertical integration requires higher upfront capex and R&amp;D, but it eliminates supplier markups across a much larger share of the vehicle.&#8221; [<a
