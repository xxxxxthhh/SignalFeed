If the core of our application becomes a black box that we don't fully understand we can no longer confidently reason about it, which makes planning new features harder and eventually slows our progress in the same way that accumulated technical debt does.</p>\n<p>How do we pay down cognitive debt? By improving our understanding of how the code works.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite ways to do that is by building <strong>interactive explanations</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-word-clouds\">Understanding word clouds</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://minimaxir.com/2026/02/ai-agent-coding/\">An AI agent coding skeptic tries AI agent coding, in excessive detail</a> Max Woolf mentioned testing LLMs' Rust abilities with the prompt <code>Create a Rust app that can create \"word cloud\" data visualizations given a long input text</code>.</p>\n<p>This captured my imagination: I've always wanted to know how word clouds work, so I fired off an <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/\">asynchronous research project</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/91#issue-4002426963\">initial prompt here</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/rust-wordcloud\">code and report here</a> - to explore the idea.</p>\n<p>This worked really well: Claude Code for web built me a Rust CLI tool that could produce images like\nthis one:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A word cloud, many words, different colors and sizes, larger words in the middle.\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/research/refs/heads/main/rust-wordcloud/wordcloud.png\" /></p>\n<p>But how does it actually work?</p>\n<p>Claude's report said it uses \"<strong>Archimedean spiral placement</strong> with per-word random angular offset for natural-looking layouts\". This did not help me much!</p>\n<p>I requested a <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/linear-walkthroughs/\">linear walkthrough</a> of the codebase which helped me understand the Rust code in more detail - here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/rust-wordcloud/walkthrough.md\">that walkthrough</a> (and <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/commit/2cb8c62477173ef6a4c2e274be9f712734df6126\">the prompt</a>). This helped me understand the structure of the Rust code but I still didn't have an intuitive understanding of how that \"Archimedean spiral placement\" part actually worked.</p>\n<p>So I asked for an <strong>animated explanation</strong>. I did this by pasting a link to that existing <code>walkthrough.md</code> document into a Claude Code session along with the following:</p>\n<p><div><markdown-copy><textarea>Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/research/refs/heads/main/rust-wordcloud/walkthrough.md to /tmp using curl so you can read the whole thing\n\nInspired by that, build animated-word-cloud.html - a page that accepts pasted text (which it persists in the `#fragment` of the URL such that a page loaded with that `#` populated will use that text as input and auto-submit it) such that when you submit the text it builds a word cloud using the algorithm described in that document but does it animated, to make the algorithm as clear to understand. Include a slider for the animation which can be paused and the speed adjusted or even stepped through frame by frame while paused. At any stage the visible in-progress word cloud can be downloaded as a PNG.</textarea></markdown-copy></div>\nYou can <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/animated-word-cloud\">play with the result here</a>. Here's an animated GIF demo:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Words appear on the word cloud one at a time, with little boxes showing where the algorithm is attempting to place them - if those boxes overlap an existing word it tries again.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/animated-word-cloud-demo.gif\" /></p>\n<p>This was using Claude Opus 4.6, which turns out to have quite good taste when it comes to building explanatory animations.</p>\n<p>If you watch the animation closely you can see that for each word it attempts to place it somewhere on the page by showing a box, run checks if that box intersects an existing word. If so it continues to try to find a good spot, moving outward in a spiral from the center.</p>\n<p>I found that this animation really helped make the way the algorithm worked click for me.</p>\n<p>I have long been a fan of animations and interactive interfaces to help explain different concepts. A good coding agent can produce these on demand to help explain code - its own code or code written by others.</p>\n    \n\n",

    "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>Just like everyone, I read Sam Altman's tweet about joining the so-called Department of War, to use ChatGPT on DoW classified networks. As others have pointed out, this is the entry point for mass surveillance and using the technology for weapons deployment. I wrote before that <a href=\"https://idiallo.com/blog/we-have-all-we-need-for-mass-surveillance\">we had the infrastructure for mass surveillance in place</a> already, we just needed an enabler. This is the enabler.</p>\n\n<p>This comes right after Anthropic's CEO wrote a public letter stating their refusal to work with the DoW under their current terms. Now Anthropic has been declared a public risk by the President and banned from every government system.</p>\n\n<p>Large language models have become ubiquitous. You can't say you don't use them because they power every tech imaginable. If you search the web, they write a summary for you. If you watch YouTube, one appears right below the video. There's a Gemini button on Chrome, there's Copilot on Edge and every Microsoft product. There it is in your IDE, in Notepad, in MS Paint. You can't escape it.</p>\n\n<p>Switching from one LLM to the next makes minimal to no difference for everyday use. If you have a question you want answered or a document to summarize, your local Llama will do the job just fine. If you want to compose an email or proofread your writing, there's no need to reach for the state of the art, any model will do. For reviewing code, DeepSeek will do as fine a job as any other model.</p>\n\n<div class=\"art-image\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.idiallo.com/images/assets/daily/95/openaisoldier.jpg\" alt=\"OpenAI war soldier\"/>\n  <p>A good use of ChatGPT's image generator.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>All this to say, ChatGPT doesn't have a moat. If it's your go-to tool, switching away from it wouldn't make much of a difference. At this point, I think the difference is psychological. For example, my wife once told me she only ever uses Google and can't stand any other search engine. What she didn't know was that she had been using Bing on her device for years. She had never noticed, because it was the default.</p>\n\n<p>When I read the news about OpenAI, I was ready to close my account. The only problem is, well, I never use ChatGPT. I haven't used it in years. My personal account lay dormant. My work account has a single test query despite my employer trying its hardest to get us to use it.</p>\n\n<p>But I think none of that matters when OpenAI caters to a government agency with a near-infinite budget. For every public account that gets closed, OpenAI will make up for it with deeper integration into classified networks.</p>\n\n<p>Not even 24 hours later, the US is at war with Iran. So while we're at it, here is a nice little link <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-to-delete-your-account\">to help you close your OpenAI account</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

    "content": "<p>Back in August 2023, we installed a <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/08/review-moixa-4-8kwh-solar-battery/\">Moixa 4.8kWh Solar Battery</a> to pair with our solar panels. For the last year and a half it has chugged away slurping up electrons and sending them back as needed. Its little fan whirrs and the lights on its Ethernet port flicker happily as it does its duty.</p>\n\n<p>I estimate that it has saved us around 3 MegaWatt hours since it was commissioned. In monetary terms, that's roughly £1,000 taken off our electricity bills.</p>\n\n<p>How did I work that out? Well, maths is hard, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKhRVSriB0\">as Barbie knows</a>, so take all this with a pinch of monosodium glutamate.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a typical month - October 2025:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/October-Battery.webp\" alt=\"Two squiggly graphs of dense complexity.\" width=\"2088\" height=\"894\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67819\">\n\n<p>Yikes! What's going on here?</p>\n\n<p>We use <a href=\"https://share.octopus.energy/metal-dove-988\">a <em>variable</em> electricity tariff</a>. Prices fluctuate every 30 minutes. At peak times our electricity prices can shoot up to 60p per Kwh. Overnight or when the wind is high, prices can drop to zero. Yes, free electricity! Sometimes the excess in the grid means that prices go negative and we are <em>paid</em> to use electricity. Hurrah!</p>\n\n<p>Our battery knows this. Its Internet connection allows it to download the tariff for the day ahead and plan accordingly. If the electricity prices are cheap, the battery fills up. The battery can decide to discharge when we're using more electricity than solar provides, or it can wait until prices are more expensive after the sun has gone down.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example, again from October:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Energy-Profile.webp\" alt=\"Bar chart showing how energy was stored and used.\" width=\"2064\" height=\"633\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67824\">\n\n<p>In October, about a third of the power stored in the battery came from the sun. About 92% was used by our house with the remainder being sold back to the grid if it was profitable to do so.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, here's June 2025 - a sunny month in the Northern Hemisphere:</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/June.webp\" alt=\"Chart showing a lot more solar usage.\" width=\"2052\" height=\"633\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67825\">\n\n<p>Here, only 12% of the battery charging was done by the grid. 88% was done for free by solar power. But because solar was so plentiful, about 15% of the battery was sold back to the grid.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"maths-is-hard\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/30-months-to-3mwh-some-more-home-battery-stats/#maths-is-hard\">Maths. Is. HARD!</a></h2>\n\n<p>I've been playing around with various charts, graphs, spreadsheets, modellers, and a bit of calculus. I basically came to the conclusion that the easiest way was to assume I was saving the <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/get-energy-price-cap-standing-charges-and-unit-rates-region\">energy price capped value of a kWh</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That varies from 25p to 35p. If I fudge the numbers just right, it rounds off at an even grand.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"its-payback-time\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/30-months-to-3mwh-some-more-home-battery-stats/#its-payback-time\">It's Payback Time</a></h2>\n\n<p>No-one ever asks what the payback period is of buying a car vs taking public transport. You never see anyone amortising an engagement ring over the length of a marriage. Still, here we are.</p>\n\n<p>We paid £2,700 for the supply, install, and commissioning of our battery.</p>\n\n<p>That means the payback time for the battery will be between 6 and 7 years. If energy prices go up, the payback time goes down.  Its capacity is showing no degradation yet and I hope it will provide us with many years of savings before it needs to be repaired or upgraded.</p>\n\n<p>Solar batteries are getting cheaper and their capacity is getting bigger - although <a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/09/how-big-a-solar-battery-do-i-need-to-store-all-my-homes-electricity/\">not big enough to store <em>all</em> my home's electricity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you can afford the upfront costs, it's like pre-paying for a chunk of your energy usage and can help protect you against sudden price rises.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://share.octopus.energy/metal-dove-988\">sign up to Octopus</a> and get a £50 bill credit if you want to switch to a variable tariff.</p>\n",

Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><p>No newsletter this week, but I&#8217;m working on a longer essay about the history of Operation Breakthrough (a greatly expanded and more thorough version of an <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/operation-breakthrough-americas-failed\">older essay</a>) that will be out next week.</p><h4><strong>Housing</strong></h4><p>Its obvious that getting housing projects permitted in the US is often quite difficult, but  it&#8217;s not always obvious how difficult. <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-much-do-construction-costs-matter\">Previous research</a> by economist Ed Glaeser has tried to quantify this by estimating the &#8220;hedonic&#8221; value of land (how much people would pay for a given amount of land space), which gives an implied value for how much the &#8220;permit&#8221; portion is worth. Now Economists Evan Soltas and Jonathan Gruber have a paper out looking at how much of a burden permitting is in the city of Los Angeles in dollar terms. From the abstract: &#8220;Permitting costs are widely cited, but little analyzed, as a key burden on housing development in leading U.S. cities. We measure them using an implicit market for &#8220;ready-to-issue&#8221; permits in Los Angeles, where landowners can prepay permitting costs and sell preapproved land to developers at a premium. <strong>Using a repeat-listing difference-in-differences estimator, we find developers pay 50 percent more ($48 per square foot) for preapproved land</strong>. Comparing similar proposed developments, preapproval raises the probability of completing construction within four years of site acquisition by 10 percentage points (30 percent). Permitting can explain one third of the gap in Los Angeles between home prices and construction costs.&#8221; Would love to see more research like this for other metro areas [<a href=\"https://x.com/esoltas/status/2025989569976361436\">X</a>]</p><p>Restricting institutional investors from owning single family homes continues to be a major political talking point, but I remain unconvinced that this has much impact on home prices. More evidence for this: A 2022 ban on investors from buying homes to rent in the Netherlands didn&#8217;t affect home prices [<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4480261\">SSRN</a>]. And there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much relationship between institutional ownership and home price appreciation at the city level.

When people move into a new, expensive unit, many of them will move from lower-cost units, which in turn will be occupied by people moving from even lower cost units, and so on. &#8220;...three researchers looked in extraordinary detail at the effects of a new 43-story condo project in Honolulu. The building, called the Central, sits right behind the giant Ala Moana shopping center, halfway between downtown and the beachfront hotels of Waikiki. It comprises both subsidized and market-rate units, priced at around $780,000 for the former, and $1.25 million for the latter. <strong>What the researchers found was that the new housing freed up older, cheaper apartments, which, in turn, became occupied by people leaving behind still-cheaper homes elsewhere in the city, and so on</strong>.

    "content": "\n        \n      <h2>Something actually new?</h2>\n<p>There’s finally been a big leap forward in coding tech unlocked by AI — not just “it’s doing some work for me”, but “we couldn’t do this before”. What’s new are a few smart systems that let coders control fleets of dozens of coding bots, all working in tandem, to swarm over a list of tasks and to deliver entire features, or even entire <em>sets</em> of features, just from a plain-English description of the strategic goal to be accomplished.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a tutorial, this is just trying to understand that something cool is happening, and maybe we can figure out what it means, and where it’s going. Lots of new technologies and buzzwords with wacky names like Gas Town and Ralph Wiggum and loops and polecats are getting as much attention as, well, anything since vibe coding. So what’s really going on?</p>\n<p>The breakthrough here came from using two familiar ideas in interesting new ways. The first idea is <em>orchestration</em>. Just like cloud computing got massively more powerful when it became routine for coders to be able to control entire fleets of servers, the ability to reliably configure and control entire fleets of coding bots unlocks a much higher scale of capability than any one person could have by chatting with a bot on their own.</p>\n<p>The second big idea is <em>resilience</em>. Just like systems got more capable when designers started to assume that components like hard drives would fail, or that networks would lose connection, today’s coders are aware of the worst shortcoming of using LLMs: sometimes they create garbage code. This tendency used to be the biggest shortcoming about using LLMs to create code, but by <em>designing</em> for failure, testing outputs, and iterating rapidly, codeless systems enable a huge advancement in the ultimate reliability of the output code.</p>\n<p>The codeless approach also addresses the other huge objection that many coders have to using LLMs for coding. The most common direct objection to using AI tools to assist in coding hasn’t just been the broken code — it’s been the many valid social and ethical concerns around the vendors who build the platforms. But codeless systems are open source, non-commercial, and free to deploy, while making it trivial to swap in alternatives for every part of the stack, including using open source or local options for all or part of the LLM workload. This isn’t software being sold by a Big AI vendor; these are tools being created by independent hackers in the community.</p>\n<p>The ultimate result is the ability to create software at scale without directly writing any code, simply by providing strategic direction to a fleet of coding bots. Call it “codeless” software.</p>\n<h2>Codeless in 10 points</h2>\n<p>If you’re looking for a quick bullet-point summary, here’s something skimmable:</p>\n<ol class=\"numbered-callout\">\n  <li>\"Codeless\" is a way to describe a new way of orchestrating large numbers of AI coding bots to build software at scale, controlled by a plain-English strategic plan for the bots to follow.</li>\n  <li>In this approach, you don't write code directly. Instead, you write a plan for the end result or product that you want, and the system directs your bots to build code to deliver that product. (Codeless abstracts away directly writing code just like \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing\">serverless</a>\" abstracted away directly managing servers.)</li>\n  <li>This codeless approach is credible because it emerged organically from influential coders who don't work for the Big AI companies, and independent devs are already starting to make it easier and more approachable. It's not a pitch from a big company trying to sell a product, and in fact, codeless tools make it easy to swap out one LLM for another.</li>\n  <li>Today, codeless tools themselves don't cost anything. The systems are entirely open source, though setting them up can be complicated and take some time. Actually running enough bots to generate all that code gets expensive quickly if you use cutting-edge commercial LLMs, but mixing in some lower-cost open tools can help defray costs. We can also expect that, as this approach gains momentum, more polished paid versions of the tools will emerge.</li>\n  <li>Many coders didn't like using LLMs to generate code because they hallucinate. Codeless systems <em>assume</em> that the code they generate will be broken sometimes, and handle that failure. Just like other resilient systems assume that hard drives will fail, or that network connections will be unreliable, codeless systems are designed to handle unreliable code.</li>\n  <li>This has nothing to do with the \"no code\" hype from years ago, because it's not locked-in to one commercial vendor or one proprietary platform. And codeless projects can be designed to output code that will run on any regular infrastructure, including your existing systems.</li>\n  <li>Codeless changes power dynamics. People and teams who adopt a codeless approach have the potential to build a lot more under their own control. And those codeless makers won't necessarily have to ask for permission or resources in order to start creating. Putting this power in the hands of those individuals might have huge implications over time, as people realize that they may not have to raise funding or seek out sponsors to build the things that they imagine.</li>\n  <li>The management and creation interfaces for codeless systems are radically more accessible than many other platforms because they're often controlled by simple plain text <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/09/how-markdown-took-over-the-world/\">Markdown</a> files. This means it's likely that some of the most effective or successful codeless creators could end up being people who have had roles like product managers, designers, or systems architects, not just developers.</li>\n  <li>Codeless approaches are probably <em>not</em> a great way to take over a big legacy codebase, since they rely on accurately describing an entire problem, which can often be difficult to completely capture. And coding bots may lack sufficient context to understand legacy codebases, especially since LLMs are sometimes weaker with legacy technologies.</li>\n  <li>In many prior evolutions of coding, abstractions let coders work at higher levels, closer to the problem they were trying to solve. Low-level languages saved coders from having to write assembly language; high-level languages kept coders from having to write code to manage memory. Codeless systems abstract away directly writing code, continuing the long history of letting developers focus more on the problem to be solved than on manually creating every part of the code.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What does software look like when coders stop coding?</h2>\n<p>As we’ve been saying for some time, for people who actually make and understand technology, the <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/\">majority AI view</a> is that LLMs are just useful technologies that have their purposes, but we shouldn’t go overboard with all of the absurd hype. We’re seeing new examples of the deep moral failings and social harms of the Big AI companies every day.</p>\n<p>Despite this, coders still haven’t completely written off the potential of LLMs. A big reason why coders are generally more optimistic about AI than writers or photographers is because, in creative spaces, AI smothers the human part of the process. But in coding, AI takes over the drudgery, and lets coders focus on the most human and expressive parts.</p>\n<p>The shame, then, is that much of the adoption of AI for coding has been in top-down mandates at companies. Rather than enabling innovation, it’s been in deployments designed to undermine their workers’ job security. And, as we’ve seen, <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/06/500k-tech-workers-laid-off/\">this has worked</a>. It’s no wonder that a lot of the research on enterprise use of AI for coding has shown little to no increase in productivity; obviously productivity improvements have not been the goal, much of the time.</p>\n<p>Codeless tech has the potential to change that. Putting the power of orchestrating a fleet of coding bots in the hands of a smart and talented coder (or designer! or product manager! or writer! or…) upends a lot of the hierarchy about who’s able to call the shots on what gets created. The size of your nights-and-weekends project might be a lot bigger, the ambitions of your side gig could be a lot more grand.</p>\n<p>It’s still early, of course. The bots themselves are expensive as hell if you’re running the latest versions of Claude Code for all of them. Getting this stuff running is hard; you’re bouncing between obscure references to Gas Town on <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge\">Steve Yegge’s Github</a>, and a bunch of smart posts on <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net\">Simon Willison’s blog</a>, and sifting through YouTube videos about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIFD0YE29Fs\">Ralph Wiggum</a> to see if they’re about the Simpsons or the software.</p>\n<p>It’s gonna be like that for a while, a little bit of a mess. But that’s a lot better than Enterprise Certified Cloud AI Engineer, Level II, minimum 11 years LLM experience required. If history is any guide, the entire first wave of implementations will be discarded in favor of more elegant and/or powerful second versions, once we know what we actually want. <a href=\"https://wiki.c2.com/?PlanToThrowOneAway\">Build one to throw away.</a> I mean, that’s kind of the spirit of the whole codeless thing, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>This could all still sputter out, too. Maybe it’s another fad. I don’t love seeing some of the folks working on codeless tools pivot into asking folks to buy memecoins to support their expensive coding bot habits. The Big AI companies are gonna try to kill it or co-opt it, because tools that reduce the switching cost between LLMs to zero must terrify them.</p>\n<p>But for the first time in a long time, this thing feels a little different. It’s emerging organically from people who don’t work for trillion dollar companies. It’s starting out janky and broken and interesting, instead of shiny and polished in a soulless live stream featuring five dudes wearing vests. This is tech made for people who <em>like making things</em>, not tech made for people who are trying to appease financiers. It’s <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/24/founders-over-funders/\">for inventors, not investors</a>.</p>\n<p>I truly, genuinely, don’t care if you call it “codeless”; it just needs a name that we can hang on it so people know wtf we’re talking about. I worked backwards from “what could we write on a whiteboard, and everyone would know what we were talking about?” If you point at the diagrams and say, “The legacy code is complicated, so we’re going to do that as usual, but the client apps and mobile are all new, so we could just do those codeless and see how it goes”, people would just sort of nod along and know what you meant, at least vaguely. If you’ve got a better name, have at it.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, though, start hacking away. Make something more ambitious than you could do on your own. Sneak an army of bots into work. Build something that you would have needed funding for before, but don’t now. Build something that somebody has made a horrible proprietary version of, and release it for free. Share your Markdown files!</p>\n<p>Maybe the distance from idea to app just got a little bit shorter? We're about to find out.</p>\n\n    \n      ",
