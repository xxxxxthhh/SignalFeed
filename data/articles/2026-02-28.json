    "content": "<p>In early January 2026, KrebsOnSecurity revealed how a security researcher disclosed a vulnerability that was used to build <strong>Kimwolf</strong>, the world&#8217;s largest and most disruptive botnet. Since then, the person in control of Kimwolf &#8212; who goes by the handle &#8220;<strong>Dort</strong>&#8221; &#8212; has coordinated a barrage of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), doxing and email flooding attacks against the researcher and this author, and more recently caused a SWAT team to be sent to the researcher&#8217;s home. This post examines what is knowable about Dort based on public information.</p>\n<p>A public &#8220;dox&#8221; created in 2020 asserted Dort was a teenager from Canada (DOB August 2003) who used the aliases &#8220;<strong>CPacket</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>M1ce</strong>.&#8221; A search on the username CPacket at the open source intelligence platform <strong>OSINT Industries</strong> finds a <strong>GitHub</strong> account under the names Dort and CPacket that was created in 2017 using the email address <strong>jay.miner232@gmail.com</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73247\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73247\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-73247\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cpacket-discord.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"537\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cpacket-discord.png 988w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cpacket-discord-768x551.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cpacket-discord-782x561.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73247\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: osint.industries.</p></div>\n<p>The cyber intelligence firm <strong>Intel 471</strong> says jay.miner232@gmail.com was used between 2015 and 2019 to create accounts at multiple cybercrime forums, including <strong>Nulled</strong> (username &#8220;Uubuntuu&#8221;) and <strong>Cracked </strong>(user &#8220;Dorted&#8221;); Intel 471 reports that both of these accounts were created from the same Internet address at Rogers Canada (99.241.112.24).</p>\n<p>Dort was an extremely active player in the Microsoft game <strong>Minecraft</strong> who gained notoriety for their &#8220;<strong>Dortware</strong>&#8221; software that helped players cheat. But somewhere along the way, Dort graduated from hacking Minecraft games to enabling far more serious crimes.</p>\n<p>Dort also used the nickname <strong>DortDev</strong>, an identity that was active in March 2022 on the chat server for the prolific cybercrime group known as <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/lapsus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LAPSUS$</a>. Dort peddled a service for registering temporary email addresses, as well as &#8220;<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/dort/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dortsolver</a>,&#8221; code that could bypass various CAPTCHA services designed to prevent automated account abuse. Both of these offerings were advertised in 2022 on <strong>SIM Land</strong>, a Telegram channel dedicated to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sim-swapping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SIM-swapping</a> and account takeover activity.</p>\n<p>The cyber intelligence firm <strong>Flashpoint </strong>indexed 2022 posts on SIM Land by Dort that show this person developed the disposable email and CAPTCHA bypass services with the help of another hacker who went by the handle &#8220;<strong>Qoft</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I legit just work with Jacob,&#8221; Qoft said in 2022 in reply to another user, referring to their exclusive business partner Dort. In the same conversation, Qoft bragged that the two had stolen more than $250,000 worth of <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Xbox Game Pass accounts</a> by developing a program that mass-created Game Pass identities using stolen payment card data.<span id=\"more-73057\"></span></p>\n<p>Who is the Jacob that Qoft referred to as their business partner? The breach tracking service <strong>Constella Intelligence</strong> finds the password used by jay.miner232@gmail.com was reused by just one other email address: <strong>jacobbutler803@gmail.com</strong>. Recall that the 2020 dox of Dort said their date of birth was August 2003 (8/03).</p>\n<p>Searching this email address at <strong>DomainTools.com</strong> reveals it was used in 2015 to register several Minecraft-themed domains, all assigned to a Jacob Butler in Ottawa, Canada and to the Ottawa phone number 613-909-9727.</p>\n<p><strong>Constella Intelligence</strong> finds jacobbutler803@gmail.com was used to register an account on the hacker forum Nulled in 2016, as well as the account name &#8220;M1CE&#8221; on Minecraft. Pivoting off the password used by their Nulled account shows it was shared by the email addresses<strong> j.a.y.m.iner232@gmail.com</strong> and <strong>jbutl3@ocdsb.ca</strong>, the latter being an address at a domain for the <strong>Ottawa-Carelton District School Board</strong>.</p>\n<p>Data indexed by the breach tracking service <strong>Spycloud</strong> suggests that at one point Jacob Butler shared a computer with his mother and a sibling, which might explain why their email accounts were connected to the password &#8220;jacobsplugs.&#8221; Neither Jacob nor any of the other Butler household members responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>The open source intelligence service <strong>Epieos</strong> finds jacobbutler803@gmail.com created the GitHub account &#8220;<strong>MemeClient</strong>.&#8221; Meanwhile, Flashpoint indexed a deleted anonymous Pastebin.com post from 2017 declaring that MemeClient was the creation of a user named CPacket &#8212; one of Dort&#8217;s early monikers.</p>\n<p>Why is Dort so mad? On January 2, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Kimwolf Botnet is Stalking Your Local Network</a>, which explored research into the botnet by <strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong>, founder of the proxy tracking service <strong>Synthient</strong>. Brundage figured out that the Kimwolf botmasters were exploiting a little-known weakness in residential proxy services to infect poorly-defended devices &#8212; like TV boxes and digital photo frames &#8212; plugged into the internal, private networks of proxy endpoints.</p>\n<p>By the time that story went live, most of the vulnerable proxy providers had been notified by Brundage and had fixed the weaknesses in their systems. That vulnerability remediation process massively slowed Kimwolf&#8217;s ability to spread, and within hours of the story&#8217;s publication Dort created a Discord server in my name that began publishing personal information about and violent threats against Brundage, Yours Truly, and others.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73249\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73249\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-73249\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ben-flyswat.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"652\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ben-flyswat.png 872w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ben-flyswat-768x668.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ben-flyswat-782x680.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dort and friends incriminating themselves by planning swatting attacks in a public Discord server.</p></div>\n<p>Last week, Dort and friends used that same Discord server (then named &#8220;Krebs&#8217;s Koinbase Kallers&#8221;) to threaten a swatting attack against Brundage, again posting his home address and personal information. Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity that local police officers subsequently visited his home in response to a swatting hoax which occurred around the same time that another member of the server posted a door emoji and taunted Brundage further.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_73245\" style=\"width: 758px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-73245\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-73245\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ben-door.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"155\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-73245\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A member of Dort&#8217;s Krebs Discord channel taunts Synthient founder Ben Brundage with a picture of a door.</p></div>\n<p>Someone on the server then linked to a cringeworthy (and NSFW) new Soundcloud <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dortdev/larpgod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">diss track</a> recorded by the user DortDev that included a stickied message from Dort saying, &#8220;Ur dead nigga. u better watch ur fucking back. sleep with one eye open. bitch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty hefty penny for a new front door,&#8221; the diss track intoned. &#8220;If his head doesn&#8217;t get blown off by SWAT officers. What&#8217;s it like not having a front door?&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With any luck, Dort will soon be able to tell us all exactly what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n",

If Ellison gains control over Warners, you can add CNN to the nonsense factory.</p>\n<p>But for a while there, it looked like the Ellisons would lose the bidding. Little Timmy (or whatever who cares) Ellison only has whatever money his dad parks in his bank account for tax purposes, and Larry Ellison is so mired in debt that one margin call could cost him his company, his fighter jet, and his Hawaiian version of Little St James Island.</p>\n<p>Warners' board may not give a shit about making good media or telling the truth or staving off fascism, but they <em>do</em> want to get paid, and Netflix has money in the bank, whereas Ellison only has the bank's money (for now).</p>\n<p>But last week, the dam broke: Warners' board indicated they'd take Paramount's offer, and Netflix withdrew their offer, and so that's that, right? It's not like Trump's FTC is going to actually block this radioactively illegal merger, despite the catastrophic corporate consolidation that would result, with terrible consequences for workers, audiences, theaters, cable operators and the entire supply chain.</p>\n<p>Not so fast! The Clayton Act &#8211; which bars this kind of merger &#8211; is designed to be enforced by the feds, state governments, and private parties. That means that California AG Rob Bonta can step in to block this merger, which he's getting ready to do:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prospect.org/2026/02/27/states-can-block-paramount-warner-deal/\">https://prospect.org/2026/02/27/states-can-block-paramount-warner-deal/</a></p>\n<p>As David Dayen writes in <em>The American Prospect</em>, state AGs block mergers all the time, even when the feds decline to step in &#8211; just a couple years ago, Washington state killed the Kroger/Albertsons merger.</p>\n<p>The fact that antitrust laws can be enforced at the state level is a genius piece of policy design. As the old joke goes, \"AG\" stands for \"aspiring governor,\" and the fact that state AGs can step in to rescue their voters from do-nothing political hacks in Washington is <em>catnip</em> for our nation's attorneys general.</p>\n<p>Bonta is definitely feeling his oats: he's also going after Amazon for price-fixing, picking up a cause that Trump dropped after Jeff Bezos ordered the <em>Washington Post</em> to cancel its endorsement of Kamala Harris, paid a million bucks to sit on the inaugural dais, millions more to fund the White House Epstein Memorial Ballroom and $40m more to make an unwatchable turkey of a movie about Melania Trump.</p>\n<p>Can you imagine how stupid Bezos is going to feel when all of his bribes to Trump cash out to nothing after Rob Bonta publishes Amazon's damning internal memos and then fines the company a <em>gazillion</em> dollars?</p>\n<p>It's a testament to the power of designing laws so they can be enforced by multiple parties. And as cool as it is to have a law that state AGs can enforce, it's <em>way cooler</em> to have a law that can be enforced by members of the public.</p>\n<p>This is called a \"private right of action\" &#8211; the thing that lets impact litigation shops like Planned Parenthood, EFF, and the ACLU sue over violations of the public's rights. The business lobby <em>hates</em> the private right of action, because they think (correctly) that they can buy off enough regulators and enforcers to let them get away with murder (often literally), but they know they can't buy off every impact litigation shop and every member of the no-win/no-fee bar.</p>\n<p>For decades, corporate America has tried to abolish the public's right to sue companies under any circumstances. That's why so many terms of service now feature \"binding arbitration waivers\" that deny you access to the courts, no matter how badly you are injured:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/27/shit-shack/#binding-arbitration\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/27/shit-shack/#binding-arbitration</a></p>\n<p>But long before Antonin Scalia made it legal to cram binding arbitration down your throat, corporate America was pumping out propaganda for \"tort reform,\" spreading the story that greedy lawyers were ginning up baseless legal threats to extort settlements from hardworking entrepreneurs. These stories are 99.9% bullshit, including urban legends like the \"McDonald's hot coffee\" lawsuit:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/hot-coffee/#mcgeico\">https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/hot-coffee/#mcgeico</a></p>\n<p>Ever since Reagan, corporate America has been on a 45-year winning streak. Nothing epitomizes the arrogance of these monsters more than the GW Bush administration's sneering references to \"the reality-based community\":</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality &#8211; judiciously, as you will &#8211; we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors&#8230;and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community</a></p>\n<p>Giving Ellison, Bezos and Musk control over our media seems like the triumph of billionaires' efforts to \"create their own reality,\" and indeed, for years, they've been able to gin up national panics over nothingburgers like \"trans ideology,\" \"woke\" and \"the immigration crisis.\"</p>\n<p>But just lately, that reality-creation machine has started to break down. Despite taking over the press, locking every reality-based reporter out of the White House, and getting Musk, Zuck and Ellison to paint their algorithms spray-tan orange, people just fucking <em>hate</em> Trump. He is underwater on <em>every single issue</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/ahead-of-state-of-the-union-address\">https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/ahead-of-state-of-the-union-address</a></p>\n<p>Despite the full-court press &#8211; from both the Dem and the GOP establishment &#8211; to deny the genocide in Gaza and paint anyone (especially Jews like me) who condemn the slaughter as \"antisemites,\" Americans condemn Israel and are fully in the tank for Palestinians:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/702440/israelis-no-longer-ahead-americans-middle-east-sympathies.aspx\">https://news.gallup.com/poll/702440/israelis-no-longer-ahead-americans-middle-east-sympathies.aspx</a></p>\n<p>Despite throwing massive subsidies at coal and tying every available millstone around renewables' ankles before throwing all the solar panels and windmills into the sea, renewables are growing and &#8211; to Trump's great chagrin &#8211; oil companies can't find anyone to loan them the money they need to steal Venezuela's oil:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kschroeder.substack.com/p/earning-optimism-in-2026\">https://kschroeder.substack.com/p/earning-optimism-in-2026</a></p>\n<p>Reality turns out to be surprisingly stubborn, and what's more, it has a pronounced left-wing bias. Putting little Huey (or whatever who cares) Ellison in charge of Warners will be bad news for the news, for media, for movies and TV, and for my neighbors in Burbank.

Our system flagged your 2:47 AM publish as anomalous.</li>\n  <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong>: We have a legitimate interest in understanding the full topology of the JavaScript ecosystem. We acknowledge this interest is difficult to distinguish from surveillance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-recipients-of-personal-data\">3. Recipients of Personal Data</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>GitHub, Inc.</strong>: Our parent company. They hold your data under a separate privacy policy. You will need to submit a separate DSAR to them. They will redirect you to Microsoft.</li>\n  <li><strong>GitHub Dependabot</strong>: Each of the 147 versions of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">buttplug</code> you have published generated automated pull requests titled “Bump buttplug” across an estimated 1,247 downstream repositories.</li>\n  <li><strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong>: Our parent company’s parent company. Their response to your DSAR will be delivered via Microsoft Teams, which you will need to install.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cloudflare, Inc.</strong>: Our CDN provider. They have observed every package you have ever downloaded. They consider this metadata, not personal data.</li>\n  <li><strong>The npm public registry</strong>: Your published packages, including their <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">package.json</code> files, are publicly available. Your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">package.json</code> from the 2:47 AM incident contained your home directory path and your OS username. We cannot un-publish this information, as at least one of the 14 downstream consumers has mirrored it to IPFS.</li>\n  <li><strong>GitHub Arctic Code Vault</strong>: Your published packages were frozen in February 2020 on archival film in a decommissioned coal mine in Svalbard, Norway.</li>\n  <li><strong>An unspecified number of CI/CD pipelines</strong>: Your packages are installed approximately 900 times per week in automated build environments. Each of these environments logs the installation. We do not control these logs, nor, as far as we can determine, does anyone else.</li>\n  <li><strong>An unknown number of software bills of materials</strong>: Under Executive Order 14028, federal software suppliers are required to produce SBOMs listing all components. Your package <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">buttplug</code> is listed as a transitive dependency in an estimated 340 SBOMs submitted as federal records to US government agencies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-retention-periods\">4. Retention Periods</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Account data</strong>: For the lifetime of your account, plus 7 years after deletion, plus the remaining useful life of physical backup media.</li>\n  <li><strong>Package data</strong>: Indefinitely. npm’s contract with the ecosystem is that published packages are permanent. Un-publishing is technically possible but discouraged since 2016.</li>\n  <li><strong>Behavioral data</strong>: 24 months in our primary database, after which it is moved to cold storage, where it remains queryable.</li>\n  <li><strong>node_modules inventories</strong>: We do not have a retention policy for this data because we did not realize we were collecting it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-your-rights\">5. Your Rights</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Right of access</strong>: You are exercising this right now.</li>\n  <li><strong>Right to rectification</strong>: You may request correction of inaccurate data. If you would like us to update the OS username in the leaked <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">package.json</code>, please note that this would require modifying a published package, which would break the integrity hash, which would cause <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">npm audit</code> to flag it as tampered, which would generate security advisories for the 14 downstream consumers, one of whom has mirrored it to a public Git repository. We advise against rectification at this time.</li>\n  <li><strong>Right to erasure</strong>: You may request deletion of your personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing. We believe there is a compelling reason: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">buttplug</code> has 1,247 direct dependents, including 3 production banking applications. Deleting your account would remove it from the registry, breaking its dependents, their dependents, and so on until an estimated 0.003% of the JavaScript ecosystem fails to build. Our legal team considers this a compelling reason.</li>\n  <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong>: You may request your data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. We have prepared your data as a 2.7 GB JSON file, available for download at a pre-signed URL that expires in 7 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Right to object</strong>: You may object to processing based on legitimate interest. If you object to our construction of the global dependency graph, your objection will be noted in the graph.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"6-automated-decision-making\">6. Automated Decision-Making</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Trust score</strong>: Our system has assigned you a trust score of 72 out of 100, based on account age, publishing frequency, two-factor authentication status, and whether you have ever mass-transferred package ownership to a stranger. The platform average is 64. The scoring methodology is proprietary.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bus factor assessment</strong>: Our system has determined that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">buttplug</code> has a bus factor of 1: You are driving the bus. This assessment has been shared with downstream maintainers who have opted into critical dependency notifications.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"7-international-transfers\">7. International Transfers</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>United States</strong>: Where our servers are located. This transfer is covered by the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which replaced Privacy Shield, which replaced Safe Harbor.</li>\n  <li><strong>47 additional countries</strong>: Your published packages are distributed via a global CDN. We cannot enumerate which edge nodes have cached your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">package.json</code> at any given time. The full list of jurisdictions is included in Appendix K.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>If you have questions about this response, please contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@npmjs.com.
