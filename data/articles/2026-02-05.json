Primogeniture did important work by keeping dynastic fortunes intact, rather than dividing them up among all children of some baron or lord or other guillotineable monster.</p>\n<p>Primogeniture persisted until the age of colonization, when Europe's \"great powers\" stole the rest of the world. In that moment, the size of Europe's great fortunes expanded by orders of magnitude. This vast increase in the wealth of Europe's most murderous, remorseless looters made primogeniture obsolete. There was so much blood-soaked money available to the nobility that <em>every</em> son could found a \"great house.\"</p>\n<p>After a couple generations' worth of this, the colonies were exhausted. There were no more lands to conquer, which meant that every son could no longer expect to found his own fortune. But for these chinless masters of the universe, a world where every son of every rich man wouldn't get his own dynasty was incomprehensible. To do otherwise was literally unimaginable. It was <em>unnatural</em>.</p>\n<p>For Piketty, this explained World War I: the world's chinless inbred monsters embarking upon an orgy of bloodletting to relieve one another of the lands &#8211; and peoples &#8211; they'd claimed as their property in order to carry on the \"eternal\" tradition of every son starting his own fortune.</p>\n<p>It's a very important idea, and a provocative explanation for one of the 20th Century's defining events. That's why it struck me so hard when I first read it, but the reason it stuck with me for the decade-plus since I encountered that it is a vital observation about the human condition: as a species, we <em>forget</em> so much. Something that was commonplace a generation ago becomes unimaginable today, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Even people who lived through those years forget who they were and what they took for granted in those days. Think, for example, of all those evangelicals who would vote for Satan himself if he promised to hang any woman who obtained an abortion; the same evangelicals who, just a few decades ago, viewed anti-abortionism as a politically suspect form of crypto-papacy:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/18/schizmogenesis/\">https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/18/schizmogenesis/</a></p>\n<p>Perhaps the reason Piketty's primogeniture-based explanation for WWI struck me so forcefully and durably is that I imbibed a prodigious amount of science fiction as a boy, including the aphorism that \"all laws are local, and no law knows how local it is\":</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-cosmopolitan-literature-for-the-cosmopolitan-web/\">https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-cosmopolitan-literature-for-the-cosmopolitan-web/</a></p>\n<p>In other words, things that seem eternal and innate to the human condition to you are apt to have been invented ten minutes before you started to notice the world around you and might seem utterly alien to your children. As Douglas Adams put it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams\">https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams</a></p>\n<p>This notion is much on my mind right now because the world is (to me, at least) unassailably in a state of change, and everything is up for grabs. Europe went from 15 years <em>behind</em> on its climate goals to <em>ten years ahead of schedule</em> after the supply of Russian gas dried up and Europeans found themselves shivering in the dark. The massive leap in EU solar means that the (seemingly) all-powerful fossil fuel lobby has absolutely, comprehensively <em>eaten shit</em>, something that was unthinkable just a few years ago:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/23/our-friend-the-electron/#to-every-man-his-castle</a></p>\n<p>Indeed, this happened so fast that many people (including many Europeans) <em>haven't even noticed that it happened</em>. Back in December, when I was at CCC in Hamburg, I talked to a bunch of European activists, close watchers of the Commission and the Parliament, who were completely convinced that Europe would never spurn the fossil fuel sector &#8211; despite the fact that <em>it had already happened</em>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it may be that intimate familiarity with European politics is a liability when things change. Spend enough time observing up close how supine European politicians and their Eurocrats are and you may find yourself so reflexively conditioned to view them as spineless corporate lackeys and thus unable to notice when they finally dig up a vertebra or two.</p>\n<p>Smart financiers are familiar with Stein's Law: \"anything that can't go on forever eventually stops.\" Change happens. Eternal verities might be fifteen minutes older than you. Pink used to be the color of ferocious masculinity, whereas blue was so girly as to be practically titular:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendered_associations_of_pink_and_blue\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendered_associations_of_pink_and_blue</a></p>\n<p>Real talk: I have serious, debilitating chronic pain. One of the reasons I'm so prolific is that the only time I stop noticing how much I hurt is when I'm lost in work (compartmentalization is a hell of a drug, and while it's not <em>always</em> healthy, it has its upsides). Ask anyone with chronic pain and they'll tell you that treating pain eventually becomes your hobby, a bottomless well of esoteric dives into various \"modalities\" of pain treatment.</p>\n<p>Thus it is that I've found myself on one or two psychologists' couches, learning about different mental approaches to living with constant pain. One of the most useful pieces of advice I've gotten was to attend closely to how my pain changes &#8211; how it ebbs and flows. The point is that if pain changes, that means that it <em>can</em> change. It <em>feels</em> eternal, but it comes and goes. Maybe someday it will go altogether. And even if it doesn't, it may improve. It probably will, at least for a while.</p>\n<p>Things change.</p>\n<p>Our current crop of cowardly, weak appeasers &#8211; in Congress, in Parliament, in the European Parliament &#8211; have, at various times (and very recently), found their spines. The factions within them that militated for the kind of bold action that might meet this moment have, from time to time, won the day. We have lived through total transformations in our politics before, and that means we might live through them again:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hypertext.niskanencenter.org/p/the-fragmentation-flywheel\">https://hypertext.niskanencenter.org/p/the-fragmentation-flywheel</a></p>\n<p>Sure, it's easy and tempting to assume that our leaders will always suck as hard as they suck now. But latent in that assumption is that the leaders who presided over big, incredible transformations were exceptional people. Maybe they were and maybe they weren't, but I'm here to tell you, ten minutes' worth of research into the biographies of the \"heroes\" of our history will reveal them to have been every bit as capable of monstrousness, cowardice, cruelty and pig-ignorant bigotry as any of today's rotating cast of fascist goons:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/disrupting-the-myth-of-franklin-d-roosevelt-in-the-age-of-trump-sanders-and-clinton/\">https://truthout.org/articles/disrupting-the-myth-of-franklin-d-roosevelt-in-the-age-of-trump-sanders-and-clinton/</a></p>\n<p>The question isn't merely \"How do we elect better leaders?\" It's \"How do we make our leaders follow <em>us</em>?\" Today's Democrats are unserious quislings who keep bringing a squirt-gun to a mass-casualty assault-rifle spree-shooting. How do we terrorize these cowards into rising to the moment? If we want Congressional Democrats to form a Nuremburg Caucus and start holding hearings on who they're going to put in the dock when the Trump regime collapses, we're going to have to drive them to it.</p>\n<p>And we <em>can</em>! The Democrats who gave us the New Deal weren't braver or more moral than the self-dealing millionaires in Congress today &#8211; they were <em>more afraid of their base</em>.</p>\n<p>Things change.</p>\n<p>Some years ago, I gave a speech at Consumer Reports headquarters in Poughkeepsie, trying to get them to refuse to give a passing grade to <em>any</em> product with DRM, on the grounds that the manufacturer could alter how that device worked at any time in the future, meaning that no matter how well a device worked now, it might turn into a pile of shit at any time in the future:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.soundguys.com/the-sonos-app-death-spiral-132873/\">https://www.soundguys.com/the-sonos-app-death-spiral-132873/</a></p>\n<p>They didn't take me up on this suggestion, obviously. They made the (seemingly) reasonable point that people bought Consumer Reports to find out what to buy, not to be told that they shouldn't buy <em>anything</em>. Every product in many key categories came with DRM, meaning that their recommendation would have had to be \"just don't buy any of it.\"</p>\n<p>But today, consumer review sites do sometimes recommend <em>nothing</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/\">https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/</a></p>\n<p>And of course, there's some precedent here. Somewhere between the emergence of the evidence for seatbelts and the appearance of seatbelts in most makes and models of cars, there would have been a time when the answer to \"which car should I buy?\" was \"don't buy a car, they're all unsafe at any speed.\"</p>\n<p>Things change. Today, every car has a seatbelt, and they'd continue to do so, even if we did away with regulations requiring seatbelts. Driving a car without a seatbelt would be as weird and terrible as using a radium suppository:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/19/just-stop-putting-that-up-your-ass/#harm-reduction\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/19/just-stop-putting-that-up-your-ass/#harm-reduction</a></p>\n<p>Things change. The nine-justice Supreme Court isn't an eternal verity. It didn't come down off a mountain on two stone tablets. It's about ten seconds old:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869</a></p>\n<p>Tomorrow, it will be different:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/20/judicial-equilibria/#pack-the-court\">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/20/judicial-equilibria/#pack-the-court</a></p>\n<p>Our eternals are all ephemerals. The idea that we should tax capital gains at half the rate of wages? It was practically invented yesterday. You know who thought we should tax all income at the same rate? That noted Bolshevik, Ronald fuckin' Reagan:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/flashback-reagan-raised-capital-gains-taxes-to-the-same-level-as-wage-taxes-for-first-time-444438edf242/\">https://archive.thinkprogress.org/flashback-reagan-raised-capital-gains-taxes-to-the-same-level-as-wage-taxes-for-first-time-444438edf242/</a></p>\n<p>We're living through a time of change. Much of it is calamitous. Some of it wondrous:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting</a></p>\n<p>It's so easy to slip into the habit of thinking that nothing will change, that our politicians will never fear us more than they love the money and power they get from catering to the Epstein class. I'm not denying that this is how they view the world today, but there was a time in living memory when it wasn't true. If it changed before, it can change again:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change\">https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/#theories-of-change</a></p>\n<p>Things change.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a name=\"linkdump\"></a></p>\n<h1 heds=\"0\">Hey look at this (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/05/contingency/#linkdump\">permalink</a>)</h1>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/heylookatthis3.jpg?w=840&#038;ssl=1\"/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Scourge of Online Sports Betting <a href=\"https://prospect.org/2026/02/04/feb-2026-magazine-sports-scourge-online-betting-fanduel-draftkings/\">https://prospect.org/2026/02/04/feb-2026-magazine-sports-scourge-online-betting-fanduel-draftkings/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ICE has offices in 5 Canadian cities.

    "content": "<p>I am both vain <em>and</em> prurient. A combination which makes me fun at parties and a delight to know.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes when I raise an issue on GitHub, or write a comment, other users leave me Emoji reactions. Perhaps a 👍 or 🎉 if they like my contribution, but occasionally a 👎 or 😕 if they're foolish enough to think I'm wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, GitHub doesn't tell me that someone has 🚀'd my wisdom. If GitHub was as good as Facebook, it would present a little 🔔 to let me know exactly how many ❤️s I have received. Instead I have to manually check every issue I've raised to see if the hive-mind judges me worthy.</p>\n\n<p>You might be thinking that there's an API for finding the reaction count to a specific piece of content - and you'd be right! The only problem is that <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reactions/reactions?apiVersion=2022-11-28\">it requires you to send it a <em>specific</em> content ID</a>. So pretty bloody useless unless you want to construct a mega-query of everything you've ever written.</p>\n\n<p>Enter the terrifying world of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/graphql\">GraphQL</a> - where men fear to tread and AIs are driven mad. It is possible to squeeze the API until the pips squeak. Here's a GraphQL query, run using the <code>gh</code> CLI, which grabs any issue with over zero reactions, displays how many reactions it received, and who gave what sort of reaction.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gh api graphql -f query='\nquery {\n  search(query: \"author:@me reactions:&gt;0\", type: ISSUE, first: 10) {\n    nodes {\n      ... on Issue {\n        url\n        reactions(last: 50) {\n          totalCount\n          nodes {\n            content\n            user {\n              login\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you might be able to decipher, that looks for the 10 most recent issues. If you are prolific, you may want to increase that number - although it will increase the time it takes for the query to run. If you have the temerity to dare to retrieve more than 100, you'll be slapped with the dreaded <code>EXCESSIVE_PAGINATION</code> error.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, it only gets the most recent 50 reactions. The count will be be the total number of reactions, no matter how low you set the number.</p>\n\n<p>In return, you'll get a hideous mass of JavaScript which looks like it has been vomited up by a disgruntled Cacodemon:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"search\": {\n      \"nodes\": [\n       {\n          \"url\": \"https://github.com/validator/validator/issues/1814\",\n          \"reactions\": {\n            \"totalCount\": 9,\n            \"nodes\": [\n              {\n                \"content\": \"THUMBS_UP\",\n                \"user\": {\n                  \"login\": \"markohoza\"\n                }\n              },\n              {\n                \"content\": \"EYES\",\n                \"user\": {\n                  \"login\": \"adamwolf\"\n                }\n              },\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is no way to get anything older. If someone liked a comment you made in 2019, you will <em>never</em> know!</p>\n\n<p>If you hate your eyes enough to read through <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#searchtype\">the search type documentation</a>, you'll notice there is no way to search Pull Requests. This is, of course, a rotten lie. If you read <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-only-issues-or-pull-requests\">different documentation</a> you'll see that PRs are classed as a type of issue. Why? Because your sanity is not worth the cost of updating things.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it makes our life slightly easier. We can search both Issues and PRs in one easy to chew lump of GraphQL:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gh api graphql -f query='\nquery {\n  search(query: \"author:@me reactions:&gt;0\", type: ISSUE, first: 100) {\n    nodes {\n      ... on Issue {\n        url\n        reactions(last: 100) {\n          totalCount\n          nodes {\n            content\n            user {\n              login\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ... on PullRequest {\n        url\n        reactions(last: 100) {\n          totalCount\n          nodes {\n            content\n            user {\n              login\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, beware gazing into the JSON lest the JSON gazes into <em>you!</em></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"search\": {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"url\": \"https://github.com/WICG/webmonetization/pull/634\",\n          \"reactions\": {\n            \"totalCount\": 2,\n            \"nodes\": [\n              {\n                \"content\": \"CONFUSED\",\n                \"user\": {\n                  \"login\": \"tomayac\"\n                }\n              },\n              {\n                \"content\": \"HEART\",\n                \"user\": {\n                  \"login\": \"tomayac\"\n                }\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        },\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>OK, so it should be pretty damned simple to get the number of reactions to any comments, right? RIGHT?!?!</p>\n\n<p>No. Because consistency is a dirty word and GraphQL was designed in the bowels of hell as a way to keep API developers from ever obtaining a state of grace.</p>\n\n<p>There's no way I could find to use <code>reactions:&gt;0</code> with a comment search query. This will get you lots of useless unreacted results. I guess you can filter them with <code>jq</code> or just scratch your monitor with razor blades so you don't have to see their empty laughing maws.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gh api graphql -f query='\nquery {\n  viewer {\n    issueComments(last: 10) {\n      nodes {\n        url\n        reactions(last: 10) {\n          totalCount\n          nodes {\n            content\n            user {\n              login\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And, again, JSON nested like wheels within wheels and fires within fires:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"viewer\": {\n      \"issueComments\": {\n        \"nodes\": [\n          {\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor/issues/6474#issuecomment-3740347148\",\n            \"reactions\": {\n              \"totalCount\": 0,\n              \"nodes\": []\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/edent/3D-UK-Money/issues/1#issuecomment-3757022146\",\n            \"reactions\": {\n              \"totalCount\": 1,\n              \"nodes\": [\n                {\n                  \"content\": \"THUMBS_UP\",\n                  \"user\": {\n                    \"login\": \"MickeyF2010\"\n                  }\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-have-we-learned-today\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/get-all-the-reactions-to-your-github-content-using-graphql/#what-have-we-learned-today\">What Have We Learned Today?</a></h2>\n\n<p>The Necronomicon was probably written in GraphQL. Any form of Daemon summoning <em>must</em> use nested queries and frightening syntax.</p>\n\n<p>Trying to track reactions to your content <em>will</em> drive you mad. There's a reason this knowledge is forbidden.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"disclaimer\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/get-all-the-reactions-to-your-github-content-using-graphql/#disclaimer\">Disclaimer</a></h2>\n\n<p>This post was not sponsored by GitHub.
