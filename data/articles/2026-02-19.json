    "content": "\n        <p>Hey all,</p>\n        <p>I'm sure you've all been aware that things have been slowing down a little with Anubis development, and I want to apologize for that. A lot has been going on in my life lately (my blog will have a post out on Friday with more information), and as a result I haven't really had the energy to work on Anubis in publicly visible ways. There are things going on behind the scenes, but nothing is really shippable yet, sorry!</p>\n        <p>I've also been feeling some burnout in the wake of perennial waves of anger directed towards me. I'm handling it, I'll be fine, I've just had a lot going on in my life and it's been rough.</p>\n        <p>I've been missing the sense of wanderlust and discovery that comes with the artistic way I playfully develop software. I suspect that some of the stresses I've been through (setting up a complicated surgery in a country whose language you aren't fluent in is kind of an experience) have been sapping my energy. I'd gonna try to mess with things on my break, but realistically I'm probably just gonna be either watching Stargate SG-1 or doing unreasonable amounts of ocean fishing in Final Fantasy 14. Normally I'd love to keep the details about my medical state fairly private, but I'm more of a public figure now than I was this time last year so I don't really get the invisibility I'm used to for this.</p>\n        <p>I've also had a fair amount of negativity directed at me for simply being much more visible than the anonymous threat actors running the scrapers that are ruining everything, which though understandable has not helped.</p>\n        <p>Anyways, it all worked out and I'm about to be in the hospital for a week, so if things go really badly with this release please downgrade to the last version and/or upgrade to the main branch when the fix PR is inevitably merged. I hoped to have time to tame GPG and set up full release automation in the Anubis repo, but that didn't work out this time and that's okay.</p>\n        <p>If I can challenge you all to do something, go out there and try to actually create something new somehow. Combine ideas you've never mixed before. Be creative, be human, make something purely for yourself to scratch an itch that you've always had yet never gotten around to actually mending.</p>\n        <p>At the very least, try to be an example of how you want other people to act, even when you're in a situation where software written by someone else is configured to require a user agent to execute javascript to access a webpage.</p>\n        <p>Be well,</p>\n        <p>Xe</p>\n        <p>PS: if you're well-versed in FFXIV lore, the release title should give you an idea of the kind of stuff I've been going through mentally.</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Add iplist2rule tool that lets admins turn an IP address blocklist into an Anubis ruleset.</li>\n        <li>Add Polish locale (<a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1309\">#1292</a>)</li>\n        <li>Fix honeypot and imprint links missing <code>BASE_PREFIX</code> when deployed behind a path prefix (<a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/1402\">#1402</a>)</li>\n        <li>Add ANEXIA Sponsor logo to docs (<a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1409\">#1409</a>)</li>\n        <li>Improve idle performance in memory storage</li>\n        <li>Add HAProxy Configurations to Docs (<a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1424\">#1424</a>)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>What's Changed</h2>\n        <ul>\n        <li>build(deps): bump the github-actions group with 4 updates by @dependabot[bot] in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1355\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1355</a></li>\n        <li>feat(localization): add Polish language translation by @btomaev in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1363\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1363</a></li>\n        <li>docs(known-instances): Alphabetical order + Add Valve Corporation by @p0008874 in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1352\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1352</a></li>\n        <li>test: basic nginx smoke test by @Xe in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1365\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1365</a></li>\n        <li>build(deps): bump the github-actions group with 3 updates by @dependabot[bot] in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1369\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1369</a></li>\n        <li>build(deps-dev): bump esbuild from 0.27.1 to 0.27.2 in the npm group by @dependabot[bot] in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1368\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1368</a></li>\n        <li>fix(test): remove interactive flag from nginx smoke test docker run c… by @JasonLovesDoggo in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1371\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1371</a></li>\n        <li>test(nginx): fix tests to work in GHA by @Xe in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1372\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1372</a></li>\n        <li>feat: iplist2rule utility command by @Xe in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1373\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1373</a></li>\n        <li>Update check-spelling metadata by @JasonLovesDoggo in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1379\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1379</a></li>\n        <li>fix: Update SSL Labs IP addresses by @majiayu000 in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1377\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1377</a></li>\n        <li>fix: respect Accept-Language quality factors in language detection by @majiayu000 in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1380\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1380</a></li>\n        <li>build(deps): bump the gomod group across 1 directory with 3 updates by @dependabot[bot] in <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1370\">https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/1370</a></li>\n        <li>Revert &quot;build(deps): bump the gomod group across 1 directory with 3 updates&quot;

    "title": "Could Write­Process­Memory be made faster by avoiding the intermediate buffer?",
    "link": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260218-00/?p=112069",
    "content": "<p>A little while ago, we wondered <a title=\"Is Write­Process­Memory faster than shared memory for transferring data between two processes?\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20251119-00/?p=111800\"> whether <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> was faster than shared memory for transferring data between two processes</a>, and the conclusion is that it wasn&#8217;t. Shared memory, as its name implies, shares the memory between two processes: The two processes are accessing the same memory; there are no copies. On the other hand, the implementation of <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> allocates a transfer buffer, copies the data from the source to the transfer buffer, then changes memory context to the destination, and then copies the data from the transfer buffer to the destination. But could <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> be optimized to avoid this copy?</p>\n<p>I mean, I guess you could do that in theory. I&#8217;m thinking, maybe create a memory descriptor list (MDL), lock and map the pages into kernel mode while in the context of the source, then change context to the destination and copy the memory to the destination. Repeat until all the memory has been copied. You don&#8217;t want to allocate a single MDL for the entire source block because the program might say that it wants to copy 100GB of memory, and if you didn&#8217;t cap the size of the transfer buffer, that would lock 100GB of RAM.</p>\n<p>But it seems overkill and unnecessary to lock the source pages. It&#8217;s fine for them to be pageable. We&#8217;re okay with them faulting in as necessary.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a way to map memory from one process into another except by locking it. I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time in kernel mode. But you do have to be careful that the mapping goes into the kernel address space and not the user-mode address space. Putting it in the user-mode address space would be a security vulnerability because the destination process can see the bytes on the source page that are not part of the memory being copied.¹</p>\n<p>But really, all of this effort is pointless. We saw that the purpose of the <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> function is not inter-process communication (IPC) but <a title=\"Of what possible legitimate use are functions like CreateRemoteThread, WriteProcessMemory, and VirtualProtectEx?\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120808-00/?p=6913\"> to be a tool for debuggers</a>. Debuggers are typically writing just a few bytes at a time, say, to patch a breakpoint instruction, and <a title=\"How is it that WriteProcessMemory succeeds in writing to read-only memory?\" href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20181206-00/?p=100415\"> the <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> function actually goes out of its way to write the memory, even in the face of incompatible memory protections</a>, though it does so in a not-thread-safe way. But that&#8217;s okay because the destination process is presumably frozen by the debugger when it calls <code>Write­Process­Memory</code>. A debugger is not going to patch a process while it&#8217;s actively running. The lack of atomicity means that patching a running process could result in the process seeing torn state, like a partly-patched variable or even a partly-patched instruction.</p>\n<p>In summary, <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> was not intended to be used as an inter-process communication channel. Its intended client is a debugger that is using it to patch bytes in a process being debugged. The very high level of access required to call the function (<code>PROCESS_<wbr />VM_<wbr />WRITE</code>) is not suitable for an inter-process communication channel, since it basically gives the writer full pwnage over the process being written to. In the case of a debugger, you <i>want</i> the debugger to have complete and total control of the process being debugged. But in the case of IPC, you don&#8217;t want to give your clients that high a level of access to your process. And even if you get past that, the lack of atomicity and lack of control over the order in which the bytes become visible in the target process means that <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> is not suitable as an IPC mechanism anyway. There&#8217;s no point trying to make a bad idea more efficient.</p>\n<p>¹ Or you could try it the other way: Map the destination into the source. But now you are giving the source read access to the destination bytes that share the same page as the destination buffer, even though the source may not have <code>PROCESS_<wbr />VM_<wbr />READ</code> access.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20260218-00/?p=112069\">Could &lt;CODE&gt;Write&shy;Process&shy;Memory&lt;/CODE&gt; be made faster by avoiding the intermediate buffer?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing\">The Old New Thing</a>.</p>\n",

I saw a problem with the spec, a convoluted way of fixing the spec. Instead of trying to verbally explain it, I started by creating a new markdown file:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>NameOfProblem.md\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then I started typing. First the problem summary, then a detailed description, then the solution and why it worked. When my partner asked questions, I incorporated his question and our discussion of it into the flow. If we hit a dead end with the solution, we marked it out as a dead end. Eventually the file looked something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Current state of spec\nProblems caused by this\n    Elaboration of problems\n    What we tried that didn&#39;t work\nProposed Solution\n    Theory behind proposed solution\n    How the solution works\n    Expected changes\n    Other problems this helps solve\n    Problems this does *not* help with\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Only once this was done, my partner fully understood the chain of thought, <em>and</em> we agreed it represented the right approach, did we start making changes to the spec. </p>\n<h3>How is this better than just making the change?</h3>\n<p>The change was <em>conceptually</em> complex. A rough analogy: imagine pairing with a beginner who wrote an insertion sort, and you want to replace it with quicksort. You need to explain why the insertion sort is too slow, why the quicksort isn't slow, and how quicksort actually correctly sorts a list. This could involve tangents into computational complexity, big-o notation, recursion, etc. These are all concepts you have internalized, so the change is simple to you, but the solution uses concepts the beginner does not know. So it's conceptually complex to them.</p>\n<p>I wasn't pairing with a beginning programmer or even a beginning specifier. This was a client who could confidently write complex specs on their own. But they don't work on specifications full time like I do. Any time there's a relative gap in experience in a pair, there's solutions that are conceptually simple to one person and complex to the other.</p>\n<p>I've noticed too often that when one person doesn't fully understand the concepts behind a change, they just go \"you're the expert, I trust you.\" That eventually leads to a totally unmaintainable spec. Hence, writing it all out. </p>\n<p>As I said before, I've only tried this once (though I've successfully used a similar idea when teaching workshops). It worked pretty well, though! Just be prepared for a lot of typing.</p>\n",

Later I realized that it was true for all of my external vendors. And much later I realized what I really should have been asking them to do.</span></p>\n<p>The lessons still apply even though AI Agents will upend all of this and PR will end up being one of the many businesses that will no longer exist in its current form.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were a new public company about to launch our first product. I had given an exclusive story to a major publication whose name is now lost in the midst of time (either the Wall Street Journal or NY Times) to what I thought was an embargo. (An embargo is a fancy term for the publication agreeing not to release the story until a specific date and time.)

So the world actually looked like this.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"33531\" data-permalink=\"https://steveblank.com/2026/02/18/you-only-think-they-work-for-you/me-and-the-pr-agency-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?fit=1812%2C906&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1812,906\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Me and the PR agency\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?fit=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?fit=468%2C234&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-33531 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?resize=468%2C234&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?resize=150%2C75&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?w=1812&amp;ssl=1 1812w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Me-and-the-PR-agency-1.jpg?w=1404&amp;ssl=1 1404w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" /></a>In actuality, my place in their universe was pretty small.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is true for almost all external vendors and consultants who supply services to companies and individuals. Think of lobbyists &#8211; they’re not going to get crosswise with government officials &#8211; those are their long term relationships. Or architects and building contractors who have essential long-term relationships with subcontractors, planning commissions, etc.</span></p>\n<p><b>One Last Thing &#8211; Learning What They Know<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn&#8217;t until much later in my career that I learned my most valuable lesson about service providers and consultants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had hired a consultant to set up distribution and manufacturing for our company in Japan. I knew nothing about those areas and got connected to a world class consultant. I made one trip to Japan with them but they did all the relationship building and knew their way around like a native. In our case, the relationship worked out– at least on the surface. But in hindsight, I realized I made an enormous strategic error. I had learned very little about how distribution and manufacturing worked in Japan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got the “service” I paid for, but didn&#8217;t realize the opportunity I lost. What I should&#8217;ve been doing to make me a better CEO was using them to teach me how Japanese distribution worked, not just doing it for me. That&#8217;s a trap I find many founders falling into. If you would have asked me then, my excuse would have been, “I don&#8217;t have enough time or bandwidth or even interest.” But the downside is that it not only makes you beholden to a service provider/consultant forever, but also you and your company can never get smarter than that single point of contact.

    "content": "\n        \n      <p>One of the key points I repeated when <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/05/a-tech-career-in-2026/\">talking about the state of the tech industry yesterday</a> was the salient fact that <em>half a million tech workers have been laid off since ChatGPT was released in late 2022</em>. Now, to be clear, those workers haven’t been laid off because their jobs are now being done by AI, and they’ve been replaced by bots. Instead, they’ve been laid off by execs who now have AI to use as an excuse for going after workers they’ve wanted to cut all along.</p>\n<p>This is important to understand for a few reasons. First, it’s key just for having empathy for both the mindset and the working conditions of people in the tech industry. For so many outside of tech, their impression of what “tech” means is whatever is the most recent transgression they’ve heard about from the most obnoxious billionaire who’s made the news lately. But in many cases, it’s the rank and file workers at that person’s company who were the first victims of that billionaire’s ego.</p>\n<p>Second, it’s important to understand the big tech companies as almost the testing grounds for the techniques and strategies that these guys want to roll out on the rest of the economy, and on the rest of the world. Before they started going on podcasts pretending to be extremely masculine while whining about their feelings, or overtly bribing politicians to give them government contracts, they beta-tested these manipulative strategies within their companies by cracking down on dissent and letting their most self-indulgent and egomaniacal tendencies run wild. Then, when people (reasonably!) began to object, they used that as an excuse to purge any dissenters for being uncooperative or “difficult”.</p>\n<h2>It starts with tech, but doesn’t end there</h2>\n<p>These are tactics they’ll be bringing to other industries and sectors of the economy, if they haven’t already. Sometimes they’ll be providing AI technologies and tools as an enabler or justification for the cultural and political agenda that they’re enacting, but often times, they don’t even need to. In many cases, they can simply make clear that they want to enforce psychological and social conformity within their organizations, and that any disagreement will not be tolerated, and the implicit threat of being replaced by automation (or by other workers who are willing to fall in line) is enough to get people to comply.</p>\n<p>This is the subtext, and sometimes the explicit text, of the deployment of “AI” in a lot of organizations. That’s separate from what actual AI software or technology can do. And it explains a lot of why the <a href=\"https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/\">majority AI view</a> within the tech industry is nothing like the hype cycle that’s being pushed by the loudest voices of the big-name CEOs.</p>\n<p>Because people who work in tech still believe in the power of tech to do good things, many of us won’t just dismiss outright the possibility that any technology — even AI tools like LLMs — could yield some benefits. But the optimistic takes are tempered by the first-hand knowledge of how the tools are being used as an excuse to sideline or victimize good people.</p>\n<p>This wave of layoffs and reductions has been described as “pursuing efficiencies” or “right-sizing”. But so many of us in tech can remember a few years back, when working in tech as an upwardly-mobile worker with a successful career felt like the best job in the world. When many people could buy nice presents for their kids at Christmas or they weren’t as worried about your car payments. When huge parts of society were promising young people that there was a great future ahead if they would just learn to code. When the promise of a tech career’s potential was used as the foundation for building infrastructure in our schools and cities to train a whole new generation of coders.</p>\n<p>But the funders and tycoons in charge of the big tech companies <em>knew</em> that they did not want to keep paying enormous salaries to the people they were hiring. They certainly knew they didn’t want to keep paying huge hiring bonuses to young people just out of college, or to pay large staffs of recruiters to go find underrepresented candidates. Those niceties that everybody loved, like great healthcare and decent benefits, were identified by the people running the big tech companies as “market inefficiencies” which indicated some wealth was going to you that should have been going to <em>them</em>. So yes, part of the reason for the huge investment in AI coding tools was to make it easier to write code. But another huge reason that AI got so good at writing code was so that nobody would ever have to pay coders so well again.</p>\n<p>You’re not wrong if you feel angry, resentful and overwhelmed by all of this; indeed, it would be absurd if you <em>didn’t</em> feel this way, since the wealthiest and most powerful people in the history of the world have been spending a few years trying to make you feel exactly this way. Constant rotating layoffs and a nonstop fear of further cuts, with a perpetual sense of precarity, are a deliberate strategy so that everyone will accept lower salaries and reduced benefits, and be too afraid to push for the exact same salaries that the company could afford to pay the year before.</p>\n<h2>Why are we stirring the pot?</h2>\n<p>Okay, so are we just trying to get each other all depressed? No. It’s just vitally important that we name a problem and identify it if we’re going to solve it.\n Most people outside of the technology industry think that “tech” is a monolith, that the people who work in tech are the same as the people who <em>own</em> the technology companies. They don’t know that tech workers are in the same boat that they are, being buffeted by the economy, and being subject to the whims of their bosses, or being displaced by AI. They don’t know that the DEI backlash has gutted HR teams at tech companies, too, for example. So it’s key for everyone to understand that they’re starting from the same place.</p>\n<p>Next, it’s key to tease apart things that are separate concerns. For example: AI is often an <em>excuse</em> for layoffs, not the cause of them. ChatGPT didn’t replace the tasks that recruiters were doing in attracting underrepresented candidates at big tech companies — the bosses just don’t care about trying to hire underrepresented candidates anymore! The tech story is being used to mask the political and social goal. And it’s important to understand that, because otherwise people waste their time fighting battles that might not matter, like the deployment of a technology system, and losing the ones that do, like the actual decisions that an organization is making about its future.</p>\n<h2>Are they efficient, though?</h2>\n<p>But what if, some people will ask, these companies just had <em>too many people</em>? What if they’d over-hired? The folks who want to feel really savvy will say, “I heard that they had all those employees because interest rates were low. It was a Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon.” This is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit. It’s not in any company’s best interests to cut their staffing down to the bone.</p>\n<p>You actually <em>need</em> to have some reserve capacity for labor in order to reach maximum output for a large organization. This is the difference between a large-scale organization and a small one. People sitting around doing nothing is the epitome of waste or inefficiency in a small team, but in a large organization, it’s a lot more costly if you are about to start a new process or project and you don’t have labor capacity or expertise to deploy.</p>\n<p>A good analogy is the oft-cited need these days for people to be bored more often. There’s a frequent lament that, because people are so distracted by things like social media and constant interruptions, they never have time to get bored and let their mind wander, and think new thoughts or discover their own creativity. Put another way, they never get the chance to tap into their own cognitive surplus.</p>\n<p>The only advantage a large organization can have over a small one, other than sheer efficiencies of scale, is if it has a cognitive surplus that it can tap into. By destroying that cognitive surplus, and leaving those who remain behind in a state of constant emotional turmoil and duress, these organizations are permanently damaging both their competitive advantages and their potential future innovations.</p>\n<h2>AI Spring</h2>\n<p>When the dust clears, and people realize that extreme greed is never the path to maximum long-term reward, there is going to be a “peace dividend” of sorts from all the good talent that’s now on the market. Some of this will be smart, thoughtful people flowing to other industries or companies, bringing their experience and insights with them.</p>\n<p>But I think a lot of this will be people starting their own new companies and organizations, informed by the broken economic models, and broken <em>human</em> models, of the companies they’ve left. We saw this a generation ago after the bust of the dot-com boom, when it was not only revealed that the economics of a lot of the companies didn’t work, but that so many of the people who had created the companies of that era didn’t even care about the markets or the industries that they’d entered. When the get-rich-quick folks left the scene, those of us who remained, who truly loved the web as a creative and expressive medium, found a ton of opportunity in being the little mammals amidst the sad dinosaurs trying to find funding for meteor dot com.</p>\n<h2>What comes next</h2>\n<p>I don’t think this all gets better very quickly. If you put aside the puffery of the AI companies scratching each others’ backs, it’s clear the economy is in a recession, even if this administration’s goons have shut down reporting on jobs and inflation in a vain attempt to hide that reality. But I do think there may be more resilience because of the sheer talent and entrepreneurial skill of the people who are now on the market as individuals.</p>\n\n    \n      ",
